----------------------------------------------------------------------

PHISH is a simple, portable library which, along with a setup script
bait.py, allows you to hook together a collection of independent
stand-alone programs so that they can collectively process streaming
or archived data and compute something of interest by sending datums
to each other.  The PHISH backend can use either the MPI or ZMQ
(socket) libraries to perform message passing.

The authors of the code are Steve Plimpton and Tim Shead, who can be
emailed at sjplimp@sandia.gov and tshead@sandia.gov.  The PHISH WWW
Site at www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/phish.html has more information about
the code and its uses.
