This directory contains MPI-only versions of minnows
useful for benchmarking purposes.  These are essentially
single-file versions of 3 PHISH inputs scripts, meant
to be run without PHISH, as standard MPI programs, via
mpirun.

pingpong.cpp            pingpong benchmark, see example/in.pingpong
chain.cpp               chain benchmark, see example/in.chain
hashed.cpp              hash benchmark, see example/in.hash

You can build all 3 of the benchmarks by typing

make -f Makefile.linux

with the appopriate Makefile for your system.  You can edit the top
portion of one of the Makefiles if none are a match to your machine.

You can run them as follows.  See the top of each of the 3 files for a
description of the arguments each one takes.

% mpirun -np 2 pingpong 1000 16
% mpirun -np 8 chain 1000 16 0
% mpirun -np 8 hashed 1000 16 0

The pingpong benchmark must be run on 2 procesors.  The chain
benchmark must be run on >= 2 processors.  The hashed benchmark must
be run on an even number of processors.

These benchmarks and their PHISH couterparts are discussed in
this paper about PHISH:
