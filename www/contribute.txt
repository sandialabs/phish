Contributing to the MapReduce-MPI library and OINK :h3

In the spirit of an open-source code, there are various ways you can
contribute to making the MR-MPI library and the OINK scripting wrapper
better.  You can send email on any of these items to the developers
listed on the "MR-MPI WWW site"_mws.

Point prospective users to the MR-MPI WWW site.  Mention it in talks
or link to it from your own WWW site. :ulb,l

If you find an error or omission in the MR-MPI or OINK documentation,
or have a suggestion for something to clarify or include, let us
know. :l

If you find a bug, please send us an email with details of how
to reproduce it. :l

If you publish a paper using MR-MPI, send the citation to
us and we can add it to the Publications page. :l

Contribute a MapReduce program which calls the MR-MPI library to be
added to the user directory in the distribution.  Or contribute an
OINK input script that does something interesting. :l

For OINK, contribute useful map() or reduce() or compare() or hash()
or scan() functions which we can add to the OINK source code, as
"described here"_oinkdoc/Section_functions.html.  Or contribute a
"named commands"_oinkdoc/Section_commands.html you have written which
can be added to OINK. :l

Create a new Makefile.machine that can be added to the src/MAKE or
oink/MAKE directories. :l

Cash. Small denominations, unmarked bills preferred. Leave in paper
sack on author's desk. VISA also accepted. Chocolate chip cookies
encouraged. :ule,l
