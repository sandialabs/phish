Latest Features and Bug Fixes in the MapReduce-MPI library :h3

This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for
the MapReduce-MPI (MR-MPI) library.

You can download the current tarball from the "download
page"_../download.html which includes all the features/fixes listed
below, and re-build MR-MPI from scratch.

What version of the MapReduce-MPI library do you have? :h4,link(version)

A MR-MPI "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  MR-MPI is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or add
a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of MR-MPI contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  Each time you use the library, the
version date is printed to the screen at the end of the run, as part
of the "cummulative statistics"_doc/stats.html, assuming the "verbosity
setting"_doc/settings.html is enabled.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the MR-MPI directory name created when you unpack
a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the MapReduce-MPI WWW site,
they always describe the most current version of MR-MPI. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they

A couple users found some bugs with the memory allocation logic that
manages pages of allocated/deallocated memory within the library,
which could lead to memory corruption issues.  This patch should fix
it.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.20Jun11 from the 30
May 2011 version.

Thanks to Holger Teutsch and John Wehle for identifying the problems.

Relaxed an error check to allow building of the MR-MPI library
on systems with 4-byte pointers.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27May11 from the 18
Mar 2011 version.

[18 Mar 2011]

Added a "histo"_oinkdoc/histo.html command to OINK, to calculate a
frequency count of unique keys in a set of key/value pairs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Mar11 from the 9
Mar 2011 version.

[9 Mar 2011]

Tweaked some header files in the OINK scripting framework to allow for
more portable 64-bit integer usage.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.9Mar11 from the 8
Mar 2011 version.

:line

[8 Mar 2011]

Added some files and commands to OINK, which are implementations
of the graph algorithms described in the new paper listed on 
the "publications"_papers.html page of the WWW site.

These include algorithms for R-MAT matrix generation, connected
component finding, triangle finding, and maximal independent set
identification.  Algorithms for PageRank and single-source
shortest-path will soon follow.

We also added OINK input scripts to test these commands in the
examples directory.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.8Mar11 from the 11
Feb 2011 version.

[11 Feb 2011]

Insure the OINK version stays current with MR-MPI version in
two source files, at each patch.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.11Feb11 from the 10
Feb 2011 version.

:line

[10 Feb 2011]

Fixed a bug with edge ordering in the "tri_find"_oinkdoc/tri_find.html
command in OINK, causing the finder to miss about half the triangles
when the input Eij didn't have Vi < Vj.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.10Feb11 from the 8
Feb 2011 version.

:line

[8 Feb 2011]

Forgot a couple files in the OINK release yesterday, like the
src/Makefile.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.8Feb11 from the 7
Feb 2011 version.

:line

[7 Feb 2011]

Release of OINK scripting framework which allows the MR-MPI library to
be called from simple input scripts, as well as new MapReduce
algorithms to be written within OINK so that data can be passed from
one command to another.  See the "OINK doc pages"_oinkdoc/Manual.html
for more details.

This release also changes the way the MR-MPI library is built to make
it easier to build for different targets simultaneously.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Feb11 from the 27
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[27 Jan 2011]

Added a "scan()"_doc/scan.html method to the MR-MPI library to
process existing key/value or key/multi-value pairs without changing or
deleting them.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27Jan11 from the 21
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[21 Jan 2011]

Added version string to distribution.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Jan11 from the 19
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[19 Jan 2011]

Changed the calling syntax of several of the "map()"_doc/map.html
methods to give more flexibility in how files are processed to
generate input.  There are options now for reading one or more files,
one or more directories of files, recursing through a directory tree
to find files, generating filenames only on processor 0 or on every
processor, and reading filenames from one or more files.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Jan11 from the 18
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[18 Jan 2011]

Added some extra diagnostic output about memory usage and fixed a
couple bugs with the new memory manager with respect to freeing memory
and the sort methods.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Jan11 from the 17
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[17 Jan 2011]

Added some "settings"_doc/settings.html that enable more precise
control of memory page usage by the library, especially when your code
creates and uses several MapReduce objects.

freepage = 1 if memory pages are freed in between operations, 0 if held
outofcore = 1 if even 1-page data sets are forced to disk, 0 if not, -1 to disable writing to disk
zeropage = 1 if zero out every allocated page, 0 if not :ul

Note that freepage default is 1, which is different behavior then
previously, when pages were allocated as needed and never released.

The default for outofcore is 0, which is the same behavior as
previously.

The default for zeropage is 0, which is different behavior than
recently, but should be invisible to the user.

Also added new variants of the "sort_key()"_doc/sort_keys.html,
"sort_value()"_doc/sort_values.html,
"sort_multivalue()"_doc/sort_multivalues.html methods, which allow for
use of internal compare functions for standard data types (int, 64-bit
int, float, double, strings, etc).  If your data to be sorted is one
of these types, then you no longer need to write and provide your own
compare function.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Jan11 from the 11
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[11 Jan 2011]

Enhanced the "gather()"_doc/gather.html method so it should now work
with a "pagesize"_doc/settings.html larger than 2 Gb.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.11Jan11 from the 6
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[6 Jan 2011]

Added some new options to the "map()"_doc/map.html method to enable
lists of files or entire directories of files to be read in as part of
a map operation.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.6Jan11 from the 1
Nov 2010 version.

:line

[1 Nov 2010]

The print() function in the Python interface was causing some problems
with Python builds, likely because it is a keyword in Python.  This
patch renames the function.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Nov10 from the 26
Aug 2010 version.

:line

[26 Aug 2010]

Forgot to add the relevant doc page for the new
"broadcast()"_doc/broadcast.html method to the distribution.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.26Aug10 from the 25
Aug 2010 version.

:line

[25 Aug 2010]

Added a "broadcast()"_doc/broadcast.html method for spreading
key/value pairs across processors.  Can by useful for taking a final
"gathered"_doc/gather.html answer and distributing it for further
processing outside the MapReduce framework.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.25Aug10 from the 22
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[22 Apr 2010]

Added a compiler flag option for the "memsize and fpath" settings,
so that the default values of 64 Mbyte pages and the current
working directory can be overridden, if desired, when the
library is built.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Apr10 from the 15
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[16 Apr 2010]

Added "open()"_doc/open.html and "close()"_doc/open.html methods to
the MR-MPI library, to make it easy to have a single
"map()"_doc/map.html or "reduce()"_doc/reduce.html add key/value pairs
to multiple MapReduce objects.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr10 from the 14
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[15 Apr 2010]

Added an internal debug option to KeyMultiValue to make it
easier to test user reduce functions that work on multi-block
KMV pairs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr10 from the 14
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[14 Apr 2010]

Added a "print()"_doc/print.html function to the library to print-out
KeyValue and KeyMultiValue pairs to the screen, useful for debugging.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Apr10 from the 15
Mar 2010 version.

:line

[15 Mar 2010]

New release of MR-MPI library.  7102 lines of code in src dir.

The new version adds the following features:

in-core operation when data sets fits in one "page" of memory
out-of-core operation otherwise
each processor writes to temporary disk files in out-of-core mode
user-settable size for a memory page via "memsize setting"_doc/settings.html
64-bit integer compatible data set sizes, enabling huge data sets :ul

See "this section of the documentation"_doc/technical.html#ooc for
further details on out-of-core operation.

See "this section of the documentation"_doc/technical.html#limits for
a discussion of the (very large) limits on data set sizes that the
library can now process.

:line

[1 Mar 2010]

Final update to in-core version before releasing out-of-core version.
This upgrade just tweaks a few small cosmetic things.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Mar10 from the 22
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[22 Apr 2009]

This upgrade adds 3 small features:

1) A timer setting that enables output of timing info from each
library call.

2) A new "map()"_doc/open.html_doc/open.html option to pass in an
existing set of key/value pairs, operate on them via the user's map
function (one key/value at a time), producing a new set of key/value
pairs.  This is an alternative to using the "clone()"_doc/clone.html
method to turn the key/value pairs into key/multivalue pairs and then
perform a reduce() on them.

3) Some clean-up inside the library of KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects when various calls transform data from one to the other.  This
should prevent users from invoking a call that uses an old KV or KMV
object that was already converted to something else by a previous
call.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Apr09 from the 19
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[19 Apr 2009]

Added some Makefiles for different machines and changed the C library
interface to the dummy MPI library, so that pure C programs can be
built with a C compiler instead of C++.  Ditto for the C examples
provided.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Apr09 from the 18
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[18 Apr 2009]

Added a dummy serial Pypar file to the examples dir, so that
the Python script examples can be run (in serial) even if
you don't have Pypar (Python wrapper on MPI) installed.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Apr09 from the 17
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[17 Apr 2009]

Enhanced the C++ and C word-frequency example programs to
read arbitrary sized text files (under 2 Gb).

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Apr09 from the 16
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[16 Apr 2009]

Restored some commented-out code in the examples/rmat.py Python
script.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Apr09 from the 15
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[15 Apr 2009]

The Python wrapper files got accidentally whacked in the 14Apr09
upgrade due to a faulty script.  This upgrade restores them.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr09 from the 14
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[14 Apr 2009]

Added an error check to the gather() function if proc count < 1
or proc count > actual procs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Apr09 from the 13
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[13 Apr 2009]

Initial public release of MR-MPI.  3730 lines of code in src dir.
This version supercedes earlier distributed beta versions.
