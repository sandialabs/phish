What version of the PHISH library do you have? :h4,link(version)

A PHISH "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Nov
2012.  PHISH is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or add
a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of PHISH contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  Each time you use the
"bait.py"_doc/Section_bait.html tool, the version date is printed to
the screen.  It is also in the file bait/version.py and in the PHISH
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the PHISH WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of PHISH. :ulb,l
