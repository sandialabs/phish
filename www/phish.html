<CENTER>Note: This site is not about Phish the band, or illicit phishing for
personal info, but about PHISH which is software for writing parallel
programs that process streaming data. 
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>This is the home page for the PHISH library, which provides a
framework for processing large volumes of data, either in a real-time
streaming context or from files.

<P>PHISH stands for Parallel Harness for Informatic Stream Hashing.  The
phishy metaphor is meant to evoke the image of a many small minnows
(programs) swimming in a stream (of data).
</P>
<P>PHISH is a lightweight framework which a set of independent processes
can use to exchange data as they run on the same desktop machine, on
processors of a parallel machine, or on different machines across a
network.  This enables them to work in a coordinated parallel fashion
to perform computations on either streaming, archived, or
self-generated data.
</P>
<P>The PHISH distribution includes a simple, portable library for
performing data exchanges in useful patterns either via <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI
message-passing</A> or <A HREF = "http://www.zeromq.org">ZMQ sockets</A>.  PHISH input scripts are
used to describe a data-processing algorithm, and additional tools
provided in the PHISH distribution convert the script into a form that
can be launched as a parallel job.
</P>
<P>PHISH was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department
of Energy facility, for use on <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/informatics.html">informatics problems</A>.  It
has a C-style interface which can be used from any hi-level language,
including C, C++, Fortran, or Python.  PHISH is distributed as an
open-source code, under the terms of the modified <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) License</A>.  See <A HREF = "open_source.html">this page</A> for
more details.
</P>
<P>The authors of PHISH are <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A> and Tim Shead, who
can be contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov and tshead at sandia.gov.

<P>The PHISH WWW site is hosted by Sandia, which has this <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/general/privacy-security/index.html">Privacy and
