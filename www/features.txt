MapReduce-MPI library features and non-features :h3

open-source C++ library
C interface provided, thus callable from any hi-level language: C++, C, Fortran, scripting language, etc
Python wrapper provided, so MapReduce programs can be written in Python
OINK scripting language wrapper provided for easy scripting and development
small, portable code base
operates in serial or on any parallel platform that supports MPI
operates in-core for data sets that fit in memory
operates out-of-core for data sets that do not :ul

no fault tolerance :ul

Fault tolerance is really an MPI issue, which future versions of MPI
may address.  Since big parallel machines never crash, nor do their
processors die, hopefully it's a non-issue for performing MapReduce
operations.
