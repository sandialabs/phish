layout command :h3

[Syntax:]

layout minnow-ID Np keyword value ... :pre

minnow-ID = ID of minnow :ulb,l
Np = # of duplicate processes to launch for this minnow :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs can be appended :l
possible keywords = {host} or {invoke}
  {host} value = machine
    machine = name of host to run the minnow on
              what if want some minnows on one host, some on another?
  {invoke} value = launcher
    launcher = run minnow via this program :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

layout 3 10
layout countapp 1
layout countapp 1 host foo.locallan.gov
layout myApp 5 invoke python :pre

[Description:]

Layout is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the "bait.py"_Bait.html setup program.  It determines
how a minnow application will be launched when the PHISH program is
run.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which
makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html to exchange data with
other PHISH minnows.

The {minnow-ID} is the ID of the minnow, as previously defined
by a "minnow"_bait_minnow.html command.

{Np} is the number of instances of this minnow that will be launched
when the PHISH program is run.

The {host} keyword sets a value used by the socket version of the
PHISH library, and thus can only be used when the {-mode socket}
command-line argument is used with "bait.py"_Bait.html.  The {machine}
value is the name of the machine (e.g. foo.locallan.gov) to launch all
the minnow processes on.

The {invoke} keyword can be used if the minnow application should be
run by another program.  For example if the minnow is a Python script,
the {launcher} could be set to "python" or to
"/usr/local/bin/python2.4".  In this case, if the minnow {exefile} was
specified as foo.py, then the launch script output by
"bait.py"_Bait.html would include a line such as

python foo.py ... :pre

instead of simply

foo.py ... :pre

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"minnow"_bait_minnow.html

[Default:]

If a layout command is not specified, then Np is assumed to be 1, so
that one process is launched when the PHISH program is run.
