<H3>1. Introduction 
</H3>
<P>This section explains what the PHISH software package is and why we
created it.  It outlines the steps to creating your own PHISH program,
and gives a simple example of using PHISH to perform a parallel
calculation.  These are the topics discussed:

<A NAME = "intro_1"></A><H4>1.1 Motivation 
</H4>
<P>Informatics is data-driven computing and is becoming more prevalent,
even on large-scale parallel machines traditionally used to run
scientific simulations.  It can involve processing large archives of
stored data or data that arrives on-the-fly in real time.  The latter
is often referred to as "streaming" data.  Common attributes of
streaming data are that it arrives continuously in a never-ending
stream, its fast incoming rate requires it be processed as it arrives
which may limit the computational effort per datum that can be
expended, and its high volume means it cannot be stored permanently so
that individual datums are examined and discarded.
</P>
<P>A powerful paradigm for processing streaming data is to use a
collection of programs, running as independent processes, connected
together in a specified communication topology.  Each process receives
datums continuously, either from the stream itself, or read from a
file, or sent to it from other processes.  It performs calculations on
each datum and may choose to store "state" internally about the stream
it has seen thus far.  It can send the datum on to one or more other
processes, either as-is or in an altered form.
</P>
<P>In this model, a data-processing algorithm can be expressed by
choosing a set of processes (programs) and connecting them together in
an appropriate fashion.  If written flexibly. individual programs can
be re-used in different algorithms.
</P>
<P>PHISH is a small software package to make the task of designing and
developing such algorithms easier, and allowing the resulting program
to be run in parallel, either on distributed memory platforms that
support MPI message passing, or on a collection of computers that
support socket connections between them.
</P>
<P>PHISH stands for Parallel Harness for Informatic Stream Hashing.
</P>
<P>Here is what these words mean, in the PHISH context.  "Parallelism"
can be achieved by using multiple copies of processes, each working on
a part of the stream, or by using the memory of multiple processes to
store state about the stream of data.  It is a framework or "harness"
for connecting processes in a variety of simple, yet powerful, ways
that enable parallel data processing.  While it is designed with
"streaming" "informatics" data in mind, it can also be used to process
archived data from files or in a general sense to perform a
computation in stages, using internally generated data of any type or
size.  "Hashing" refers to sending datums to specific target processes
based on the result of a hash operation, which is one means of
achieving parallelism.
</P>
<P>It is important to note that PHISH does not replace or even automate
the task of writing code for the individual programs needed to process
data, or of designing an appropriate parallel algorithm to perform a
desired computation.  It is simply a library that processes can call
to exchange datums with other processes, and a setup tool that
converts an input script into a runnable program that can be easily
launched in parallel.
</P>
<P>Our goal in developing PHISH was to make it easier to process data,
particularly streaming data, in parallel, on distributed-memory or
geographically-distributed platforms.  And to provide a framework to
quickly experiment with parallel informatics algorithms, either for
streaming or archived data.  Our own interest is in graph algorithms
but various kinds of statistical, data mining, machine learning, and
anomaly detection algorithms can be formulated for streaming data, in
the context of the model described above.  We hope PHISH can be a
useful tool in those settings as well.

<A NAME = "intro_2"></A><H4>1.2 PHISH lingo 
</H4>
<P>The name PHISH was also chosen because it evokes the image of fish
(programs) swimming in a stream (of data).  This unavoidably gives
rise to the following PHISH lingo, which we use without apology
throughout the rest of the documentation:
</P>
<UL><LI>minnow = a (typically small) stand-alone application, run as a process
<LI>school = a set of duplicate minnows, swimming together in a coordinated fashion
<LI>hook = a connection between two schools in a defined communication pattern
<LI>net(work) = a PHISH program, consisting of one or more schools, hooked together to perform a calculation
<LI>bait.py = a tool for creating PHISH nets from an input script
<LI>wrapper = a wrapper of the PHISH library for Python
<LI>tales = the <A HREF = "Manual.html">PHISH manual</A> 
</UL>
<HR>

<A NAME = "intro_3"></A><H4>1.3 PHISH pheatures 
</H4>
<P>The model described above is not unique to PHISH.  Many programs
provide a framework for enabling data to flow between computational
tasks interconnected by "pipes" in a dataflow kind of paradigm.
Visualization programs often use this model to process data and
provide a GUI framework for building a processing pipeline by
connecting the outputs of each computational node to the inputs of
others.  The open source <A HREF = "http://titan.html">Titan package</A>, built on top of VTK,
is one example, which provides a rich suite of computation methods,
both for visualization and data processing.  The commercial
<A HREF = "http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/stream-computing">InfoSpheres tool from IBM</A> uses a similar dataflow model, and is
designed for processing streaming data at high rates.  Twitter
recently released an open-source package called "Twitter Storm" which
has been advertised as <A HREF = "http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</A> for streaming data, since it
enables streaming MapReduce-style computations and runs with
fault-tolerance on top of a parallel file system like HDFS.  PHISH has
many conceptual similarities to Storm, though PHISH has fewer
features, such as no support for fault tolerance.
</P>








<P>Dataflow frameworks like these are often designed to run as a single
process or in parallel on a shared memory machine.  The computational
nodes in the processing pipeline are functions called as needed by a
master process, or launched as threads running in parallel.
</P>
<P>By contrast, PHISH minnows (computational nodes in the processing
pipeline), are independent processes and the PHISH library moves data
between them via "messages" which requires copying the data, either
using the MPI message-passing library or sockets.  This allows PHISH
programs to be run on a broader range of hardware, notably
distributed-memory parallel platforms, but also incurs a higher
overhead for moving data from process to process.
</P>
<P>The following list highlights additional PHISH pheatures:
</P>
<UL><LI>The PHISH package is open-source software, distributed under the
Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license.  This effectively means
that anyone can use the software for any purpose, including commercial
redistribution. 

<LI>The PHISH library is a small piece of code (few 1000 lines), with a
compact API (couple dozen functions).  It has a C interface, so that
it can be easily called from programs written in a variety of
languages (C, C++, Fortran, Python, etc).  The library can be compiled
on any platform with a C++ compiler. 

<LI>The PHISH library comes in two flavors with the same API: one based on
message passing via the MPI library, the other based on sockets via
the open-source <A HREF = "http://www.zeromq.org">ZMQ</A> library.  This means you need one or both of
these packages (MPI, ZMQ) installed on your machine to build a minnow
(process) that uses the PHISH library. 



<LI>PHISH nets (programs) consist of one or more collections of minnows
(schools), hooked together in defined communication patterns, to
encode an algorithm or computation, The toplogy of a PHISH net is
specified in an input script, which is text files with a simple
command syntax. 

<LI>PHISH minnows can define one or more input and output ports for
sending and receiving datums.  This allows schools of minnows to be
hooked together in a variety of communication patterns. 

<LI>PHISH minnows can be written to operate on datums of various types
(e.g. integers or floating-point values or strings).  This allows
minnows to be re-used in various PHISH nets. 

<LI>A PHISH wrapper (pun intended) for Python is provided, so that minnows
that call the PHISH library can be written in Python.  Minnows written
in different languages (e.g. C++ or Python) can be used
interchangeably in a PHISH input script. 

<LI>The PHISH library exchanges data between minnows with strict data
typing rules, so that minnows can be written in different languages
(e.g. C++ vs Fortran vs Python) or run on different machines (4-byte
vs 8-byte integers).  

<LI>PHISH input scripts are processed via a tool called
<A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool which can also run them as an MPI
or socket-based program. 

<LI>PHISH input scripts use a <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command which
allows data to be exchanged in various patterns between schools of
minnows.  This enables parallelism in data processing to be easily
expressed and exploited. 

<LI>PHISH nets can be run on a single processor, so long as the OS
supports multiple processes.  They can be run on a multicore box.
They can be run on any distributed-memory or shared-memory platform
that supports MPI or sockets.  Or they can be run on a geographically
dispersed set of machines that support socket connections. 

<LI>A PHISH net can look for incoming data on a socket port.  It can
likewise export data to a socket port.  This means that two or more
PHISH nets can be launched independently and exchange data.  This is a
mechanism for adding/deleting minnows (processes) to/from a
calculation on the fly. 

<LI>PHISH minnows are included that wrap non-PHISH applications that read
from stdin and/or write to stdout.  This allows such an application to
be used in a PHISH net and exchange data with other minnows.

<A NAME = "intro_4"></A><H4>1.4 Steps to create and run a PHISH net 
</H4>
<P>The PHISH package contains a library and a tool for defining and
running PHISH nets.  These are the steps typically used to perform a
calculation, assuming you have designed an algorithm that can be
encoded as a series of computational tasks, interconnected by moving
data between them.

step (1).

<HR>

<A NAME = "intro_5"></A><H4>1.5 Simple example 
</H4>
<P>The steps outlined in the preceding section are somewhat abstract.
Here is a concrete example of using a PHISH program to count the
number of times different words appear in a corpus of text files.
This is effectively a MapReduce operation, where individual minnow
processes perform the map() and reduce() functions.  This is a diagram
of how 5 different kinds of minnows can be connected together to
perform the computation:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "JPG/wordcount.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Code for all 5 of these minnows is in the example directory of the
PHISH distribution, both in C++ and Python.  The <I>filegen</I> minnow
takes a list of files and/or directories as user input, searches them
recursively, and generates a series of filenames.  The filenames are
sent one-at-a-time to one of several <I>file2words</I> minnows.  Each
receives a filename as input, opens and reads the content, and parses
it into words.  Each word is hashed and sent to a specific <I>count</I>
minnow, as indicated by the all-to-all green arrows.  The key point is
that each <I>count</I> minnow will receive all occurrences of a subset of
possible words.  It uses an internal hash table to count the
occurrences of each word it receives.  Note that parallelism is
enabled by invoking multiple copies of the <I>file2words</I> and <I>count</I>
minnows.
</P>
<P>When the <I>filegen</I> minnow sends the last filename, it sends a "done"
message to each of the <I>file2words</I> minnows.  When they receive a
"done" message, they in turn send a "done" message to each <I>count</I>
minnow.  When a <I>count</I> minnow has received a "done" message from all
the <I>file2words</I> minnows, it sends its entire list of unique words and
associated counts to the <I>sort</I> minnow, followed by a "done" message.
When the <I>sort</I> minnow has received "done" message from all the
upstream <I>count</I> minnows, it knows it has received all the unique
words in the corpus of documents, and the count for each one.  It
sorts the list by count and sends the top <I>N</I> to the <I>print</I> minnow,
followed by a "done" message.  <I>N</I> is a user-defined parameter.  The
<I>print</I> minnow echoes each datum it receives to the screen or a file,
until if receives a "done" message.  At this point all minnows in the
school have been shut down.
</P>
<P>More details about this example are discussed in subsequent sections
of the manual:
</P>
<UL><LI>In <A HREF = "Section_bait.html#bait_4">this section</A> of the bait.py tool doc
page, the PHISH input script that encodes the minnows and
communication connections of the above diagram is discussed, and its
processing by the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool. 

<LI>In <A HREF = "Section_minnows.html#minnow_1">this section</A> of the PHISH Minnows
doc page, the code for the <I>count</I> minnow is discussed in detail, to
illustrate what calls it makes to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
send and receive datums. 

<LI>In <A HREF = "Section_library.html#datum">this section</A> of the PHISH Library doc
page, the format of datums exchanged between minnows is
discussed. 
</UL>
<P>Note that like a MapReduce, the PHISH program runs in parallel, since
there can be N <I>file2words</I> minnows and M <I>count</I> minnows where N >=
1, M >= 1, and N = M is not required.  This is similar to the option
in <A HREF = "http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</A> to vary the numbers of mappers and reducers.
</P>
<P>However, there are also some differences between how this PHISH
program works as compared to a traditional MapReduce, e.g. as
typically performed via <A HREF = "http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</A> or the <A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov">MapReduce-MPI
library</A>.
</P>


<P>In a traditional MapReduce, the "map" stage (performed by the
<I>file2words</I> minnows) creates a huge list of all the words, including
duplicates, found in the corpus of documents, which is stored
internally (in memory or on disk) until the "mapper" process is
finished with all the files it processes.  Each mapper then sends
chunks of the list to each "reduce" process (performed by the <I>count</I>
minnows).  This is the "shuffle" phase of a Hadoop MapReduce.  The
reducer performs a merge sort of all the words in the chunks it
receives (one from each mapper).  It can then calculate the count for
each unique word.
</P>
<P>In contrast, the PHISH program operates in a more fine-grainded
fashion, streaming the data (words in this case) through the minnows,
without ever storing the full data set.  Only a small list of unique
words is stored (by the <I>count</I> minnows), each with a running counter.
PHISH exchanges data between minnows via many tiny messages (one word
per message), whereas a traditional MapReduce would aggregate the data
into a few large messages.
</P>
<P>This is a simplistic explanation; a fuller description is more
complex.  <A HREF = "http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</A>, for example, can operate in streaming mode
for some forms of MapReduce operations, which include this wordcount
example (MapReduce operations where the "reducer" needs all data
associated with a key at one time, are not typically amenable to a
streaming mode of operation.)  The PHISH minnows used in this school
could be modified so as to aggregate data into larger and fewer
messages.  Likewise, in a traditional MapReduce, large intermediate
data sets can be stored out-of-core.  PHISH does have the capability
to do that unless a minnow is written that writes information to disk
and retrieves it.
</P>
<P>However the fundamental attributes of the PHISH program are important
to understand.  Data moves continuously, in small chunks, through a
school of minnows.  Each minnow may store "state" information about
the data it has previously seen, but typically not all the data
itself.  "State" is typically limited to information that can be
stored in-memory, not on disk.  This is because for streaming data,
too much data arrives too quickly, for a minnow to perform much
computation before discarding it or sending it on to another minnow.
</P>
<P>Here is a diagram of a variant of the wordcount operation that
illustrates how PHISH can be used to process continuous, streaming
data.  The PHISH program in this case might run for days or weeks,
without using the "done" messages described above.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "JPG/wordcount2.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>In this case the <I>filegen</I> minnow is continuously seeing new files
appear in directories it monitors.  The words in those files are
processed as they appear.  A <I>Trigger</I> minnow has been added which
accepts user queries, e.g. via a keyboard or a socket connection.
When the user makes a request (hits a key), a message is sent to each
of the <I>count</I> minnows on a different input port than it receives
words from the <I>file2words</I> minnows; see <A HREF = "Minnows.html#minnow_2">this
section</A> of the <A HREF = "Minnows.html">PHISH Minnows</A> doc
page for a discussion of ports.  The message triggers the <I>count</I>
minnows to send their current unique word/count list to the <I>sort</I>
minnow which is sorted and printed via the <I>print</I> minnow.
</P>
<P>The PHISH job now runs continuously and a user can query the current
top N words as often as desired.  The <I>filegen</I>, <I>count</I>, and <I>sort</I>
minnows would have to be modified, but only in small ways, to work in
this mode.  Additional logic could be added (e.g. another user
request) to re-initialize counts or accumulate counts in a
time-windowed fashion.
