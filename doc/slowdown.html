<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Slowdown is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In
<A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>The slowdown minnow sends datums as it receives them, but insures
successive datums are sent no more often than every <I>delta</I> seconds.
This can be useful for debugging PHISH nets that process
data quickly.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The shutdown minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one
output port 0 to send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>When it starts, the shutdown minnow calls the
<A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> function.  Each time a datum is received
on input port 0, the phish_timer function is called and the elapsed
time since the last datum was sent is calculated.  If it is less
than <I>delta</I> seconds, the minnow "sleeps" until <I>delta</I> seconds have
passed.  It then sends the datum to its output port 0 and records
the time at which the send occurred.
</P>
<P>The count minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>The shutdown minnow does not care what kinds of datums it receives and
re-sends.
