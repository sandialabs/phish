[Description:]

Minnow is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the "bait.py"_Bait.html setup program.  It defines a
minnow application and assigns it an ID which can be used elsewhere in
the input script.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.

The {ID} of the minnow can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.

The {exefile} is the name of the executable which will be launched
when the PHISH program is run.  It should reside in one of the
directories specified by the {-path} command-line argument for
"bait.py"_Bait.html.

The {arg1}, {arg2}, etc keywords are arguments that will be passed
to the {exefile} program when it is launched.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]
