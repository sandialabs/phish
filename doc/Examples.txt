5. Examples :h3

This is the list of example PHISH input scripts provided:

** in.pp = ping-pong test between 2 processes

2 procs, each connect to each other via one2one
send message of M bytes back-and-forth N times

** in.test = test bait.py syntax processing

arbitrary commands to test that bait.py can process it correctly

** in.wc = word count from files

open files from list
convert to words
count word occurrence
sort to keep top N
print the results

can use many procs for file reading and accumulating counts
like MapReduce

** in.wrapsink = reverse each filename in a list of filenames

uses wrapssink
pass filenames to simple standalone reverse program
can launch multiple instances of reverse

** in.wrapss = reverse each filename in a list of filenames

uses wrapss
wrap simple standalone reverse program
can launch multiple instances of reverse
