[Description:]

This is a PHISH library function which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html.

This function is typically the final function called by a minnow
during its setup phase, after the minnow has defined its input and
output ports via the "phish_input"_phish_input.html and
"phish_output"_phish_output.html functions.  It must be called before
any datums are received or sent to other minnows.

The function checks that the input and output ports defined by the
minnow are consistent with their usage in the PHISH input script, as
processed by the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool.

Specifically, it does the following:

checks that required input ports are used by the script
checks that no ports used by the script are undefined by the minnow
opens all ports used by the script so that data exchanges can begin :ul
