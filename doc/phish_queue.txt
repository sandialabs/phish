[Description:]

These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html.

These functions are used to store and retrieve datums in an internal
queue maintained by the PHISH library.  This can be useful if a minnow
receives a datum but wishes to process it later.

:line

The phish_queue() function stores the most recently received datum in
the internal queue.  It returns the number of datums in the queue,
which includes the one just stored.

The phish_queue() function does not conflict with
"phish_unpack"_phish_unpack.html or "phish_datum"_phish_unpack.html
functions.  They can be called before or after a phish_queue() call.

:line

The phish_dequeue() function retrieves a stored datum from the
internal queue and copies it into the receive buffer, as if it had
just been received.  The datum is deleted from the queue, though it
can be requeued via a subsequent call to phish_queue.

After a call to phish_dequeue, the datum can be unpacked or its
attributes queried via the "phish_unpack"_phish_unpack.html or
"phish_datum"_phish_unpack.html functions, as if it just
been received.

The input parameter "n" for phish_dequeue is the index of the datum to
retrieve.  N can be any value from 0 to Nqueue-1 inclusive, where
Nqueue is the number of datums in the queue.  Thus you can easily
retrieve the oldest or newest datum in the queue.

:line

The phish_nqueue() function returns the number of datums currently
held in the internal queue.
