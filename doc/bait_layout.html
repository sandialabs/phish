<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Layout is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It determines
how a minnow application will be launched when the PHISH program is
run.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which
makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to exchange data with
other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>The <I>minnow-ID</I> is the ID of the minnow, as previously defined
by a <A HREF = "bait_minnow.html">minnow</A> command.
</P>
<P><I>Np</I> is the number of instances of this minnow that will be launched
when the PHISH program is run.
</P>
<P>The <I>host</I> keyword sets a value used by the socket version of the
PHISH library, and thus can only be used when the <I>-mode socket</I>
command-line argument is used with <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A>.  The <I>machine</I>
value is the name of the machine (e.g. foo.locallan.gov) to launch all
the minnow processes on.
</P>
<P>The <I>invoke</I> keyword can be used if the minnow application should be
run by another program.  For example if the minnow is a Python script,
the <I>launcher</I> could be set to "python" or to
"/usr/local/bin/python2.4".  In this case, if the minnow <I>exefile</I> was
specified as foo.py, then the launch script output by
<A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> would include a line such as
</P>
<PRE>python foo.py ... 
</PRE>
<P>instead of simply
</P>
<PRE>foo.py ... 
</PRE>

<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>If a layout command is not specified, then Np is assumed to be 1, so
that one process is launched when the PHISH program is run.
