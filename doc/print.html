<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows.
</P>
<P>The print minnow prints the datums it receives to stdout or to a file.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The print minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums.  It does
not use any output ports.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>When it starts, the print minnow opens <I>outfile</I> if it has been
specified.  It then calls the <A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> function.
Each time a datum is received on input port 0, its fields are looped
over.  Each field is written in the appropriate format with a trailing
space, either to the screen or to <I>outfile</I>.  A trailing newline is
written after all the fields have been written.
</P>
<P>The print minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.  Before shutting
down it closes <I>outfile</I> if it was specified.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>The count minnow can receive datums with any number of fields.
Any type of field can be printed, except for fields of type
PHISH_RAW, which are ignored.  Array-type fields are printed
one value at a time, with trailing spaces.
</P>
<P>NOTE: print minnow needs some additional logic for
various added field types
