[Syntax:]

ping N M :pre

[Description:]

Ping is a PHISH minnow that can be used as one of a school of minnows
in a PHISH program.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.


wrap a child process which creates datums by writing to stdout

syntax: wrapsource -f "program"
-f is optional

if -f is specified, receive filenames in stream and
  invoke child process on each filename
  generate "program" via sprintf() using filename as arg
  so "program" presumably has %s in it
if -f is not specified, invoke child process just once using "program"

"program" can be any string with flags, redirection, etc
enclose in quotes to prevent shell from processing it

read lines of output from child one by one as datums via a pipe
send them downstream

for each datum:
  launch the child process on the filename
  read all its output until child exits
  send each line of output downstream vis phish_send w/out newline


[Restrictions:]

Note: set command may be required to boost buffer size
