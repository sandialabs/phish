reflect messages to a receiver

syntax: ping N M
N = # of times to ping/pong with partner proc
M = # of bytes in a message

fill M-byte buffer with NULLs
send it and go into loop

for each datum:
  when recv from partner
  increment count and send back to partner
  when count hits M, send done message
