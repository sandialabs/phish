<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions are used to send datums to other minnows.  Before a
datum can be sent, it must be packed into a buffer.  See the doc page
for the <A HREF = "phish_pack.html">phish_pack</A> functions to see how this is
done.
</P>
<P>All datums are sent via output ports the minnow defines and which the
PHISH input script uses to route datums from one set of minnows to
another set.  Thus these send functions all take an <I>iport</I> argument
to specify which output port to send thru.
</P>
<P>The specific minnow(s) that the datum will be sent to is determined by
the connection style(s) defined for the output port.  See the PHISH
input script <A HREF = "bait_connect.html">connect</A> command, as discussed on the
<A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool doc page, for details.  Some connection
styles require additional information from the minnow to route the
datum to the desired minnow.  This is the reason for the
phish_send_key() and phish_send_direct() variants of phish_send().
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_send() function sends a datum to the specified <I>iport</I>
output port.
</P>
<P>This generic form of a send can be used for all connection styles
except the HASHED and DIRECT styles.  See the PHISH input script
<A HREF = "bait_connect.html">connect</A> command for details.  Note that multiple
sets of receiving minnows, each with their own connection style, can
be connected to the same output port.
</P>
<P>If phish_send() is used with a HASHED or DIRECT connection style,
an error will result.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_send_key() function sends a datum to the specified <I>iport</I>
output port and allows specification of a byte string or <I>key</I> of
length <I>nbytes</I>, which will be hashed by the PHISH library and
converted into an index for choosing a specific receiving processor to
send the datum to.
</P>
<P>This form of sending must be used for a HASHED connection style.  See
the PHISH input script <A HREF = "bait_connect.html">connect</A> command for
details.  If one or more of the connection styles connected to the
output port is not a HASHED style, then the <I>key</I> and <I>nbytes</I>
arguments are ignored, and the generic phish_send() form is used to
send the datum.
</P>
<P>NOTE: does Python syntax not include len?
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_direct() function sends a datum to the specified <I>iport</I>
output port and allows a specific receiving minnow to be selected via
the <I>receiver</I> argument.  The <I>receiver</I> is an integer offset into the
set of receiving minnows connected to this output port.  If there are
<I>M</I> minnows in the receiving set, then 0 <= <I>receiver</I> < M is
required.  The <A HREF = "phish_init.html">phish_school</A> function can be used to
query information about the receiving set of minnows.
</P>
<P>This form of sending must be used for a DIRECT connection style.  See
the PHISH input script <A HREF = "bait_connect.html">connect</A> command for
details.  If one or more of the connection styles connected to the
output port is not a DIRECT style, then the <I>reciever</I> argument is
ignored, and the generic phish_send() form is used to send the datum.
