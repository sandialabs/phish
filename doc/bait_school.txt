school command :h3

[Syntax:]

school minnow-ID Np keyword value ... :pre

minnow-ID = ID of minnow :ulb,l
Np = # of instances of this minnow to launch :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs can be appended :l
possible keywords = {host} or {bind}
  {host} value = machine
    machine = name of host to run all the minnows on
  {bind} values = N1,C1 N2,C2 ...
    N1,C1 = node ID, core ID for first minnow
    N2,C2 = node ID, core ID for second minnow, etc
    see discussion below for wildcard format :pre

:ule

[Examples:]

school 3 10
school countapp 1
school countapp 1 host foo.locallan.gov
school myApp 5 bind *,0
school myApp 2 bind 0,0 3,2
school myApp 5 bind 0*1,* 2,0 :pre

[Description:]

School is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the "bait.py"_Bait.html setup program.  It determines
how a minnow application will be launched when the PHISH program is
run.  In "PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow" is a
stand-alone application which makes calls to the "PHISH
library"_Library.html to exchange data with other PHISH minnows.

The {minnow-ID} is the ID of the minnow, as previously defined
by a "minnow"_bait_minnow.html command.

{Np} is the number of instances of this minnow that will be launched
when the PHISH program is run.

The {host} keyword sets a value used by the socket version of the
PHISH library, and thus can only be used when the {-mode socket}
command-line argument is used with "bait.py"_Bait.html.  The {machine}
value is the name of the machine (e.g. foo.locallan.gov) to launch all
the minnow processes on.

The {bind} keyword is only relevant when running a PHISH program under
MPI.  It allows you to control which nodes and cores of a multi-core
machine that each instance of each minnow will run on.  Each minnow
instance is an MPI process, so if there are 2 schools of minnows with
{Np} values of 12 and 8, then there are 20 MPI processes, with MPI
ranks from 0 to 19 inclusive.

If you do not specify the {bind} option for any minnow, then the 20
processes will be assigned to the nodes and cores with whatever
options you sepcify with the mpirun command.  By default this is
typically first by core, then by node.  I.e. on a machine with
quad-core nodes, the 12 instances of the first minnow would run on the
12 cores of the first 3 nodes, and the 8 instances of the second
minnow on the 8 cores of the last 2 nodes, since your job will be
allocated 5 nodes when mpirun requests 20 processes for the entire
PHISH program.

If you want to change the default assignments in a manner not
enabled by options on the mpirun command, then the {bind}
option can be used.  It must be specified for every minnow and
thus for every school command.

To use the {bind} values, bait.py needs to know how many cores per
node Nc there are on the machine you will run on.  This can be
specified by the "set pernode"_bait_set.html command; it defaults to 1
if not set.  Bait.py uses this to infer how many nodes Nn you will run
on, i.e. Nn = Nprocs / Nc, where Nprocs is the total number of
minnow instances (MPI processes).  Nn is rounded up if Nprocs is not
evenly divisible by Nc.

The {bind} keyword takes one or more node/core ID pairs as values.
Node IDs must be from 0 to Nn-1 inclusive.  Core IDs must be from 0 to
Nc-1 inclusive.  Each node and core ID can represent a range of
consecutive node and core IDs if it is specified using a wildcard.
This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = Nn or Nc for
node or core count, then an asterisk with no numeric values means all
IDs from 0 to N-1 (inclusive).  A leading asterisk means all IDs
from 0 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all IDs from n
to N-1 (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all IDs from m to n
(inclusive).  Specifying an ID that is < 0 or >= N is an error.

For each {bind} value an ordered list L of node/core IDs is generated,
with the core ID varying first, then the node ID.  If there are
multiple {bind} values, the lists are concatenated together to form
one long list.  For example, on a machine with 4 cores per node,
and 3 nodes allocated for your PHISH run, this command

school myApp 5 bind 1*,* 0,2* :pre

would generate the following list L of node/core ID pairs, of length
10:

(1,0), (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,3) :pre

As a final step, the minnow instances are assigned to this list in
order.  I.e. the first minnow instance will run on the 1st node/core
ID, the 2nd instance of the minnow on the 2nd node/core ID, etc.

If the number of instances Ni < the length of the list L, then only
the first Ni node/core ID pairs are used.  If Ni > length of L, then
the list is looped over until all minnow instances are assigned.  Note
that this will run multiple minnow instances on the same core.

This assignment information is passed to MPI in different ways for
MPICH versus OpenMPI.  For MPICH is it via a host file; for OpenMPI it
is via a rankfile.  The output printed by the bait.py command tells
you how to specify the appropriate mpirun command.

[Restrictions:] none

[Default:]

If a school command is not specified, then Np is assumed to be 1, so
that one process is launched when the PHISH program is run.
