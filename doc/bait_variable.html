</P>
<P>Variable is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which
is recognized by the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It
creates a variable with name <I>ID</I> which contains a list of one or more
strings.  The variable can be used elsewhere in the input script.  The
substitution rules for variables are described by the
<A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>The <I>ID</I> of the variable can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.  The strings can contain any printable character.
</P>
<P>A variable can only be defined once, i.e. IDs must be unique.  The one
exception is for variables defined as <A HREF = "Section_bait.html#bait_3">command-line
arguments</A> to the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A>
command.  In this case, a variable command in the input script is
ignored if the variable was already set in the command line.  This
allows an input script to set default values for variables that can be
overridded by command-line settings.

<P>There is one variable that must be set when using the ZMQ backend to
<A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A>.  It's ID is "hostnames" and it should be
a list of the hostnames on which to launch the PHISH job.  If you are
running on a large parallel machine, it is typically the names of the
nodes assigned to your job by the batch allocator.  If you are running
on your desktop, it can be just the hostname of your machine.  E.g.
</P>
<PRE>variable hostnames rsnode3 rsnode4 rsnode10
variable hostnames mybox
variable hostnames mybox otherbox.localnet.gov 
</PRE>
<P>This variable is used by the ZMQ backend to determine what host to
launch each minnow on.  See the bind option of the <A HREF = "bait_school.html">bait.py
school</A> command for further discussion and how to
assign specific minnows to specific hosts.

<P>Any variable can be set in a PHISH input script or via the
<I>--variable</I> or <I>-v</I> command-line arguments of the
<A HREF = "Secttion_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.
