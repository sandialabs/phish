</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>filegen path1 path2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>path1,path2,... = one or more file or directory names 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Filegen is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In
<A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows via its input and output ports.
</P>
<P>The filegen minnow generates a list of filenames from the filenames
and directory names given to it as arguments.  Each directory is
opened (recursively) and scanned to generate filenames.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The filegen minnow uses no input ports.  It uses one output port 0 to
send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>When it starts, the filegen minnow loops over its input arguments.  If
the argument is a file, it sends the filename to its output port 0.
If the argument is a directory name, it reads all the filenames in the
directory and sends each one to its output port 0.  If any entry in
the directory is itself a directory, then it recurses and generates
sends additional filenames to its output port 0.
</P>
<P>When it has processed all its input arguments, the filegen minnow
calls the <A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A> function to shut down.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>Each datum the filegen minnow sends has a single field of type
PHISH_STRING.
