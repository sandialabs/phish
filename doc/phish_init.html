<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a PHISH library function which can be called from a minnow
application.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A>.
</P>
<P>A PHISH program typically includes one or more schools of minnows, as
specified in a PHISH input script.  Each minnow in each school is an
individual process.  Locally, each minnow has a local-ID from
0 to Nlocal-1 within its school, where <I>Nlocal</I> is the number of minnows
in the school.  Globally, each minnow has a global-ID from 0 to
Nglobal-1, where <I>Nglobal</I> is the total number of minnows in the net.  The
global-IDs are ordered by school, so that minnows within each school have
consecutive IDs.  These IDs enable the PHISH library to orchestrate
communication of datums between minnows in different schools.  E.g. when
running the MPI version of the PHISH library, the global-ID
corresponsds to the rank ID of an MPI process, used in MPI_Send() and
MPI_Recv() function calls.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "phish_query.html">phish_query</A> function for how a minnow can
find out these values from the PHISH library.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_init() function must be the first call to the PHISH library
made by a minnow.  Since it alters the command-line arguments passed
to the minnow, it is typically the first executable line of a minnow
program.
</P>
<P>It's purpose is to initialize the library using special command-line
arguments passed to the minnow when it was launched, typically by the
the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool that parses a PHISH input script.
</P>
<P>The two arguments to phish_init() are pointers to the number of
command-line arguments, and a pointer to the arguments themselves as
an array of strings.  These are passed as pointers, because the PHISH
library reads and removes the PHISH-specific arguments.  It then
returns the remaining minnow-specific arguments, which the minnow can
read and process.  As is standard with C programs, the returned value
of argv includes argv[0] which is the name of the minnow executable.
</P>
<P>Note that in the Python version of phish.init(), the full argument
list is passed as an argument, and the truncated argument list is
returned.
</P>
<P>Following are some sample switches and arguments that the MPI version of the
PHISH library looks for and processes.  These are generated automatically by
the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool when it processes a PHISH input script so
you don't need to think about these arguments, but it may be helpful in
understanding how PHISH works.  Note that the following arguments may change at
any time.
</P>
<UL><LI>--phish-backend mpi
<LI>--phish-minnow ID Nlocal Nprev
<LI>--phish-memory N
<LI>--phish-safe M
<LI>--phish-self S
<LI>--phish-in sprocs sfirst sport style rprocs rfirst rport
<LI>--phish-out sprocs sfirst sport style rprocs rfirst rport 
</UL>
<P>The <I>--phish-backend</I> switch appears once, and is followed by the version of the
PHISH library specified by bait.py.  This allows the PHISH library to detect
incompatible runtime environments, e.g. mixing minnows linked against the socket
version of the PHISH library with minnows using the MPI version.
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-minnow</I> switch appears once.  ID is the school ID in the PHISH input
script.  The <I>Nlocal</I> argument was explained above.  <I>Nprev</I> is the total
number of minnows in sets of minnows previous to this one.  It is used to infer
the <I>local-ID</I> value discussed above.
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-memory</I> and <I>--phish-safe</I> and switches change default settings within
the PHISH library.
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-memory</I> value <I>N</I> sets the maximum size of the buffers used to
send and receive datums.  See the <A HREF = "bait_set.html">set</A> command of
the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool for more information on the
settings of this switch.
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-safe</I> switch forces the MPI version of the PHISH library
to use MPI_SSend() calls every <I>M</I> messages it sends, instead of the
standard MPI_Send() when <I>M</I> is nonzero.  These are "safer" in the
sense they insure messages are not dropped due to a minnow not keeping
up with its incoming messages.  See the <A HREF = "bait_set.html">set</A> command of
the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool for more information on the
settings of this switch.
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-self</I> switch sets the size of the buffer used by the MPI
version of the PHISH library to perform non-blocking buffered sends
via the MPI_BSend() call.  These calls are only made when a minnow
sends a message to itself, e.g. in a looping fashion as specified by a
<A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command in a PHISH input script.  <I>S</I> specifies
the number of maximum-size self messages that can be queued before the
minnow receives them.  See the <A HREF = "bait_set.html">set</A> command of the
<A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool for more information on the settings
of this switch.
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-in</I> switch appears once for every connection the minnow has with
other minnows, where it is a receiver of datums.  See the
<A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command in PHISH input scripts processed
by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool, for more information.
</P>
<P><I>Sprocs</I>, <I>sfirst</I>, and <I>sport</I> refer to the set of minnows sending to
this minnow.  They are respectively, the number of minnows in the set,
the global ID of the first minnow in the set, and the output port used
by those minnows.  <I>Rprocs</I>, <I>rfirst</I>, and <I>rport</I> refer to the set of
minnows receivng the datums, i.e. the set of minnows this minnow
belongs to.  They are respectively, the number of minnows in the set,
the global ID of the first minnow in the set, and the input port used
by those minnows.  <I>Style</I> is the connection style, as specified by
the <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command in the PHISH input script
processed by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.  E.g. <I>style</I> is a word
like "single" or "hashed".  If it is "subscribe", then extra info
about the external host and its TCP port is appended to the <I>style</I>,
e.g. "subscribe/www.foo.com:25".
</P>
<P>The <I>--phish-out</I> switch appears once for every connection the minnow has
with other minnows, where it is a sender of datums.  See the
<A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command in PHISH input scripts processed
by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool, for more information.
</P>
<P><I>Sprocs</I>, <I>sfirst</I>, and <I>sport</I> refer to the set of minnows sending
datums, i.e. the set of minnows this minnow belongs to.  They are
respectively, the number of minnows in the set, the global ID of the
first minnow in the set, and the output port used by those minnows.
<I>Rprocs</I>, <I>rfirst</I>, and <I>rport</I> refer to the set of minnows receivng
the datums.  They are respectively, the number of minnows in the set,
the global ID of the first minnow in the set, and the input port used
by those minnows.  <I>Style</I> is the connection style, as specified by
the <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command in the PHISH input script
processed by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.  E.g. <I>style</I> is a word
like "single" or "hashed".  If it is "publish", then extra info about
the TCP port is appended to the <I>style</I>, e.g. "publish/25".
</P>
<P>The PHISH library ignores any remaining arguments, returning them to to the
minnow caller, including the name of the minnow executable in argv[0].
</P>
<P>The phish_init() function also flags each specified input port and
output port with a CLOSED status, instead of UNUSED.  See the
<A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command for the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool
for more info about communication ports.  See the
<A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A> and <A HREF = "phish_output.html">phish_output</A>
functions for more info about port status.
</P>
<P>The "C" binding to phish_init() returns a nonzero value if there were errors,
otherwise zero.  The "C++" binding to phish::init() throws an exception if
there were errors.
