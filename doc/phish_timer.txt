printf("Elapsed time = %g\n",t2-t1); :pre

[C++ syntax:]

double timer() :pre

[C++ examples:]

#include "phish.hpp"

[Description:]

This is a PHISH library function which can be called from a minnow
application.  In "PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the "PHISH
library"_Library.html.

This function provides a portable means to time operations within
a minnow.  For the MPI version of the PHISH library, the function
is a wrapper on MPI_Wtime().

NOTE: how does this work for socket version?

The function returns the current time in CPU seconds.  To calculated
an elapsed time, you need to bracket a section of code with 2 calls to
phish_timer() and calcualte the difference between the 2 returned
times, as in the example above.

[Restrictions:] none
