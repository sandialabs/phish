[Description:]

This is a PHISH library function which can be called from a minnow
application.  In "PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the "PHISH
library"_Library.html.

This function provides a portable means to time operations within a minnow.
The function returns the current wallclock time as a timestamp measured in
seconds.  To calculate an elapsed time, you need to bracket a section of code
with 2 calls to phish_timer() and compute the difference between the 2 returned
times, as in the example above.
