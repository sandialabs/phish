file2words minnow :h3

[Syntax:]

file2words :pre

this minnow takes no arguments :ul

[Examples:]

file2words :pre

[Description:]

File2words is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In
"PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows via its input and output ports.

The file2words minnow open a file, reads its contents, parses it into
words separated by whitespace, and outputs each word.

[Ports:]

The file2words minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one
output port 0 to send datums.

[Operation:]

When it starts, the file2words minnow calls the
"phish_loop"_phish_recv.html function.  Each time a datum is received
on input port 0, its first field is treated as a filename.  The file
is opened and its contents are read a line at a time.  Each line is
parsed into words, separated by whitespace.  Each word is sent as an
individual datum to its output port 0.  The file is closed when it has
all been read.

The filewords minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by
receiving a sufficient number of "done" messages.

[Data:]

The file2words minnow msut receive single field datums of type
PHISH_STRING.  It also sends single field datums of type PHISH_STRING.

[Restrictions:]

The C++ version of the file2words minnow allocates a buffer of size
MAXLINE = 1024 bytes for reading a line from a file.  This can be
changed (by editing minnow/file2words.cpp) if longer lines are needed.

It also assumes the filenames it receives are for text files, so that
"whitespace" as defined in C or Python makes sense as a separator.
