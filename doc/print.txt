print minnow :h3

[Syntax:]

print -f filename :pre

-f = optional switch for writing to a file
filename = name of file to write to :ul

[Examples:]

print
print -f outfile :pre

[Description:]

Print is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the "PHISH library"_Library.html to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows.

The print minnow prints the datums it receives to stdout or to a file.

[Ports:]

The print minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums.  It does
not use any output ports.

[Operation:]

When it starts, the print minnow opens {outfile} if it has been
specified.  It then calls the "phish_loop"_phish_recv.html function.
Each time a datum is received on input port 0, its fields are looped
over.  Each field is written in the appropriate format with a trailing
space, either to the screen or to {outfile}.  A trailing newline is
written after all the fields have been written.

The print minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.  Before shutting
down it closes {outfile} if it was specified.

[Data:]

The count minnow can receive datums with any number of fields.
Any type of field can be printed, except for fields of type
PHISH_RAW, which are ignored.  Array-type fields are printed
one value at a time, with trailing spaces.

NOTE: print minnow needs some additional logic for
various added field types
[Restrictions:] none

[Related minnows:] none
