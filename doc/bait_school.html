<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>School is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It
determines how a minnow application will be launched when the PHISH
program is run.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a
"minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>The <I>minnow-ID</I> is the ID of the minnow, as previously defined
by a <A HREF = "bait_minnow.html">minnow</A> command.
</P>
<P><I>Np</I> is the number of instances of this minnow that will be launched
when the PHISH program is run.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>bind</I> keyword allows you to control what machine or what nodes
and cores of a multi-core machine that each instance of a minnow will
run on.
</P>
<P>There are 3 ways to do this assignment in PHISH; each is discussed
below.
</P>
<UL><LI>via the mpirun command (only possible for the MPI backends of
<A HREF = "Section_bait.html"">bait.py</A>) 

<LI>via the <I>bindorder</I>, <I>pernode</I>, and <I>numnode</I> settings of the <A HREF = "bait_set.html">bait.py
set</A> command or bait.py <I>--set</I> or <I>-s</I> <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">command-line
switches</A> 

<LI>via the <I>bind</I> options of the bait.py school command, as illustrated
above 
</UL>
<P>The examples below use a PHISH input script with 2 schools of minnows,
the first with a school <I>Np</I> setting of 12, the second with 8, for a
total of 20 minnows or processes.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Here is how binding works for the MPI backends to the bait.py command.
</P>
<P>If <I>bindorder</I> is unset (or set to 0) and no <I>bind</I> keywords are used
with the school command, then minnows will be assigned to the nodes by
the mpirun command.  By default this is typically first by core, then
by node.  E.g. on a machine with quad-core nodes, the 12 instances of
the first minnow would run on the 12 cores of the first 3 nodes, and
the 8 instances of the second minnow on the 8 cores of the last 2
nodes, since your job will be allocated 5 nodes when mpirun requests
20 processes for the entire PHISH program.  The mpirun commands for
different versions of MPI have options that can be used to control the
assignment, e.g. to assign first by node, then by core.  See the man
pages for mpirun for details.
</P>
<P>The other 2 methods of assignment will override any options to the
mpirun command.
</P>
<P>If <I>bindorder</I> is set to 1 or 2, and no <I>bind</I> keywords are used with
the school command, then minnows are assigned to cores in the
following manner, using the <I>pernode</I> and <I>numnode</I> settings of the
<A HREF = "bait_set.html">bait.py set</A> command.
</P>
<P>If <I>bindorder</I> is set to 1, then minnows are assigned in a double
loop, with the inner loop over cores from 0 to pernode-1 and the
outer loop over nodes from 0 to numnode-1.  E.g. on a machine with
quad-core nodes, the 12 instances of the first minnow would run on the
12 cores of the first 3 nodes, and the 8 instances of the second
minnow on the 8 cores of the last 2 nodes, since your job will be
allocated 5 nodes when mpirun requests 20 processes for the entire
PHISH program.  This assumes that you have set <I>pernode</I> to 4 and
<I>numnode</I> to 5; the latter is the default.
</P>
<P>If <I>bindorder</I> is set to 2, then minnows are assigned in a double
loop, with the inner loop over nodes from 0 to numnode-1 and the outer
loop over cores from 0 to pernode-1.  E.g. on a machine with quad-core
nodes, the 12 instances of the first minnow would be spread across all
5 nodes (3 on the first 2, 2 on the last 3), as would the 8 instances
of the second minnow (1 on the last 2, 2 on the last 3), since your
job will be allocated 5 nodes when mpirun requests 20 processes for
the entire PHISH program.  This again assumes that you have set
<I>pernode</I> to 4 and <I>numnode</I> to 5.
</P>
<P>But if you were allocated 12 nodes and are only running 20 minnows,
you could set <I>numnode</I> to 12 and <I>bindorder</I> to 2.  The 12 instances
of the first minnow would be spread across all 12 nodes (1 each), and
the 8 instances of the second minnow would be spread across the first
8 nodes (1 each).
</P>
<P>If the <I>bind</I> keyword is used with any school command, it must be used
with all of them.  If it is used, then each minnow is assigned
explicitly to a specific node and core, so that the methods of
assignment just described are overridden.  However if wildcards are
used in the explicit assignments, then the <I>bindorder</I>, <I>pernode</I>, and
<I>numnode</I> settings are used, as explained below.
</P>
<P>The <I>bind</I> keyword takes one or more node/core ID pairs as values.
Node IDs must be from 0 to <I>numnode</I>-1 inclusive.  Core IDs must be
from 0 to <I>pernode</I>-1 inclusive.  Each node and core ID can represent
a range of consecutive node and core IDs if it is specified using a
wildcard.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N =
<I>numnode</I> or <I>pernode</I> for node or core count, then an asterisk with
no numeric values means all IDs from 0 to N-1 (inclusive).  A leading
asterisk means all IDs from 0 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk
means all IDs from n to N-1 (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all
IDs from m to n (inclusive).  Specifying an ID that is < 0 or >= N is
an error.
</P>
<P>For each <I>bind</I> value an ordered list of explicit node/core IDs is
generated, expanding each value with wildcards as needed.  If both the
node and core ID have a wildcard then the value is expanded in a
double loop.  The ordering of the double loop is controlled by the
<I>bindorder</I> setting as explained above: inner/outer = core/node for
bindorder 1, inner/outer = node/core for bindorder 2.
</P>
<P>For example, on a machine with 4 cores per node (<I>pernode</I> = 4), and 3
nodes allocated for your PHISH run (<I>numnode</I> = 3), this command
</P>
<PRE>school myApp 5 bind 1*,* 0,2* 
</PRE>
<P>would generate the following list of 10 node/core ID pairs:
</P>
<PRE>(1,0), (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,3) 
</PRE>
<P>The minnow instances are assigned to this list in order.  I.e. the
first minnow instance will run on the 1st node/core ID, the 2nd
instance of the minnow on the 2nd node/core ID, etc.
</P>
<P>If the number of instances Ni < the length of the list, then only the
first Ni node/core ID pairs are used.  If Ni > length of the list,
then the list is looped over until all minnow instances are assigned.
Note that this can result in multiple minnows being assigned to the
same core.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Binding for the ZMQ backends to the bait.py command works the
same way as for the MPI backends, with 3 differences.
</P>
<P>(1) The first method described above, i.e. letting the mpirun command
assign minnows to physical processors, is not an option.  One of the
other 2 methods must be used.
</P>
<P>(2) Once a minnow has been assigned to a node ID and core ID, the core
ID is ignored.
</P>
<P>(3) The node ID is converted to a machine hostname.  The set of
possible hostnames is determined by the "variable hostnames" command.
As described on that doc page, a hostname can be a machine name
(foo.localnet.gov) or a node name on a parallel machine (rs2001).
</P>
<P>The ZMQ backend launches each minnow on a specific hostname.  If the
host is a multi-core node, then it may launch multiple minnows on the
node, relying on the node operating system to distribute the minnow
processes efficiently across cores.
</P>
<P>As described above each node ID is a value <I>N</I> from 0 to <I>numnode</I>-1
inclusive.  This value is used to index into the list of hostnames.
If the list length <I>L</I> is smaller than <I>N</I>, then the index = <I>N</I> mod
<I>L</I>.  E.g. if the node ID <I>N</I> is 10 and the hostname list is of length
4, then the node maps to the 3rd hostname in the list (index = 2).

<P>If a school command is not specified for a particular minnow, then Np
is assumed to be 1, so that one instance of the minnow is launched
when the PHISH program is run.
