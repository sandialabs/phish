<P>Echo is a stand-alone program.  Unlike other PHISH minnows in the
minnows directory of the PHISH distribution, it is not a program that
needs to be linked with the PHISH library.  It is provided for
illustration purposed, because it can be wrapped with the
<A HREF = "wrapss.html">wrapss</A> minnow so that can it be used as one of a school
of minnows in a PHISH program.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a
stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
