<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions are used to unpack a datum after it has been received
from another minnow or query other info about the datum.
</P>
<P>As discussed in <A HREF = "Library.html#datum">this section</A> of the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
Library</A> doc page, datums sent and recived by the PHISH
library contain one or more fields.  A field is a fundamental data
type, such as an "32-bit integer" or "vector of doubles" or a
NULL-terminated character string.  These fields are
<A HREF = "phish_pack.html">packed</A> into a contiguous byte string when then are
sent, using integer flags to indicate what type and length of data
comes next.  These unpack functions allow the minnow to extract data
from the datum, one field at a time.
</P>
<P>Note that these functions return pointers to the internal buffer
holding the datum within the PHISH library.  The buffer will be
overwritten when the minnow returns control to the PHISH library and
the next datum is received.  Typically this occurs when a callback
function in the minnow returns.  This means that if you want the data
to persist within the minnow, you must make a copy.  It is OK to
unpack several fields from the same datum before making copies of the
fields.  It is also OK to pack one or more received fields for sending
and wait to send it until after another datum is received.  This is
because calls to "phish_pack" functions copy data into a separate send
buffer.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_unpack() function returns the next field and its length,
from the most recently received datum.  Note that <I>len</I> is typed as a
pointer to int32_t which is a 32-bit integer.  In C or C++, the minnow
can simply declare <I>len</I> to be a pointer to "int" and the function
will work as expected.  The only case where this will fail (with a
compile-time error) is if the native "int" on a machine is not a
32-bit int.
</P>
<P>Phish_unpack returns an integer flag set to one of these values
(defined in src/phish.h):
</P>
<UL><LI>PHISH_CHAR = 0

<LI>PHISH_INT32 = 3
<LI>PHISH_INT64 = 4
<LI>PHISH_UINT8 = 5
<LI>PHISH_UINT16 = 6
<LI>PHISH_UINT32 = 7
<LI>PHISH_UINT64 = 8

</UL>
<P>PHISH_CHAR, PHISH_INT*, PHISH_UINT*, PHISH_FLOAT, and PHISH_DOUBLE are
a single character, a signed integer (of length 8,16,32,64 bits), an
unsigned integer (of length 8,16,32,64 bits), a float (typically 4
bytes), and a double (typically 8 bytes).
</P>
<P>PHISH_RAW is a string of raw bytes which can store whatever the
sending minnow put into its send buffer, e.g. a C data structure
containing a collection of various C primitive data types.
</P>
<P>PHISH_RAW is a string of raw bytes which minnows can format in any
manner, e.g. a C data structure containing a collection of various C
primitive data types.  PHISH_STRING is a standard C-style
NULL-terminated C-string.  The NULL is included in the field.
</P>
<P>The ARRAY types are contiguous sequences of int*, uint*, float, or
double values, packed one after the other.
</P>
<P>PHISH_PICKLE is an option available when using the Python wrapper on
the PHISH library to encode arbitrary Python objects in pickled form
as a string of bytes.  It should not normally be used in a minnow
written in C or C++.
</P>
<P>Phish_unpack also returns <I>buf</I> and <I>len</I>.  <I>Buf</I> is a char pointer to
where the field starts.  You will need to cast this to the appropriate
data type before accessing the data if it is not a character string.
<I>Len</I> is the length of the field, with the following meanings:
</P>
<UL><LI>PHISH_CHAR: len = 1
<LI>PHISH_INT*: len = 1
<LI>PHISH_UINT*: len = 1
<LI>PHISH_FLOAT: len = 1
<LI>PHISH_DOUBLE: len = 1
<LI>PHISH_RAW: len = # of bytes
<LI>PHISH_STRING: len = # of bytes, including the trailing NULL
<LI>PHISH_INT*_ARRAY: len = # of int8 or int16 or int32 or int64 values
<LI>PHISH_UINT*_ARRAY: len = # of uint8 or uint16 or uint32 or uint64 values
<LI>PHISH_FLOAT_ARRAY: len = # of float values
<LI>PHISH_DOUBLE_ARRAY: len = # of double values
<LI>PHISH_PICKLE = len = # of bytes 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>The phish_datum() function returns information about the most recently
received datum.
</P>
<P>If <I>flag</I> is set to 0, phish_datum returns the number of fields in the
datum.  This value is also passed as an argument to the callback
function invovked by the <A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> and
<A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_probe</A> functions, so a minnow typically does
not need to use phish_datum to retrieve this info.
</P>
<P>If <I>flag</I> is set to 1, phish_datum returns the input port the datum
was received on.  See the <A HREF = "phish_port.html">phish_port</A> functions for a
discussion of ports.
</P>
<P>The phish_datum() function does not conflict with the phish_unpack()
function.  Phish_datum() can be called before or after or in between a
series of phish_unpack() calls.
