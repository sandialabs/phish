<H3>3. PHISH Minnows 
</H3>
<P>In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes
calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.  Typically they are small
programs which perform a single task, e.g. they parse a string into
keywords and store statistics on those keywords.
</P>
<P>Hooked together by connections to other sets, in various communication
patterns
</P>
<P>Often come in sets as specified by input script.  Parallel if working
in tandem with other duplicate minnows, each processing a subset of
datums.
</P>
<P>This doc page covers these topics:

<P>This is a list of minnows in the minnow sub-directory of the PHISH
distribution.  Some are written in C++, some in Python, some in both:

<P>These are special minnows which can wrap stand-alone non-PHISH
applications which read from stdin and write to stdout, so that they
can be used in as minnows in a PHISH program:

<P>regular datum vs done message
</P>
<P>For a PHISH program whose minnows operate in a pipelined
one-directional fashion (e.g. one or more minnows read input,
send datums to a 2nd set of minnows, on to a 3rd set, etc), it
is typically sufficient to trigger an orderly shutdown of
the entire program 
</P>
<P>one-way schools, triggered by head
done messages, per port level
close ports explicitly or implicitly
calls to exit, close, etc
special care for ring or chain connections
or when school has loops

<P>shutdown in ZMQ is buggy
