<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions are used to receive datums sent by other minnows.
</P>
<P>All received datums arrive on input ports the minnow defines and which
the PHISH input script uses to route datums from one set of minnows to
another set.
</P>
<P>The functions documented on this page receive the next datum,
whichever input port it arrives on.  It is up to the minnow to take
the appropriate port-specific action if necessary.  This can be done
by defining a port-specific callback function via the
<A HREF = "phish_port.html">phish_input</A> function.  Or by querying what port the
datum was received on via the <A HREF = "phish_unpack.html">phish_datum</A>
function.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_loop() function turns control over to the PHISH library.  It
will wait for the next datum to arrive on any input port.  When it
does one of three things happen:
</P>
<P>(1) For a regular datum, phish_loop() will make a callback to the
minnow, to the <I>datum</I> callback function assigned to the input port
the datum was received on.  See the <A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A>
function for how this callback function is assigned.  When the
callback function returns, control is returned to phish_loop().
</P>
<P>(2) For a datum that signals the closure of an input port,
phish_loop() will make a callback to the minnow, to the <I>done</I>
callback function assigned to the input port the datum was received
on.  See the <A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A> function for how this
callback function is assigned.  When the callback function returns,
control is returned to phish_loop().
</P>
<P>(3) For a datum that closes the last open input port, step (2) is
performed, and then an additional callback to the minnow is made, to
the <I>alldone</I> callback function (optionally) assigned by the
<A HREF = "phish_done.html">phish_done</A> function.  When the callback function
returns, control is returned to phish_loop().
</P>
<P>After option (3) has occurred, phish_loop() returns, giving control
back to the minnow.  Typically, the minnow will then clean up and call
<A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A>, since all its input ports are closed and
no more datums can be received.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_probe() function is identical to phish_loop(), except that
instead of waiting for the next datum to arrive, phish_probe() checks
if a datum has arrived.  If not, then it immediately calls the
specified <I>probefunc</I> callback function.  This allows the minnow to do
useful work while waiting for the next datum to arrive.
</P>
<P>The <I>probefunc</I> function should have the following form:
</P>
<PRE>void probefunc() {
} 
</PRE>
<P>or
</P>
<PRE>def provefunc() 
</PRE>
<P>in Python,
</P>
<P>where "datumfunc" is replaced by a function name of your choice.  When
the <I>probefunc</I> callback function returns, control is returned to
phish_probe().
</P>
<P>Note that just like phish_loop(), phish_probe() will not return
control to the minnow, until option (3) above has occured, i.e. all
input ports have been closed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_recv() function allows the minnow to request datums
explicitly, rather than be handing control to phish_loop() or
phish_probe() and being called back to by those functions.
</P>
<P>The phish_recv() function checks if a datum has arrived and returns
regardless.  It returns a value of 0 if no datum is available.  It
returns a value N > 0 if a datum has arrived, with N = the number of
fields in the datum.  See the <A HREF = "phish_unpack.html">phish_unpack</A> and
<A HREF = "phish_datum.html">phish_datum</A> doc pages for info on how the received
datum can be further processed.
</P>
<P>If a datum is received that signals the closure of an input port, then
phish_recv() will perform the same options (2) and (3) listed above,
making callbacks to the <I>done</I> callback function and <I>alldone</I>
callback function as appopriate, and then return with a value of -1.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>These functions can only be called after
<A HREF = "phish_check.html">phish_check</A> has been called.
