<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Hook is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It determines
how the output from a minnow in one school is routed to the input of a
minnow in another school when the PHISH program is run.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH
lingo</A>, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>The topology of communication patterns between minnows defined by a
series of hook commands defines how multiple schools of minnows are
harnessed together to perform a desired computational task.  It also
defins how parallelism is exploited by the schools of minnows.
</P>
<P>A hook is made between two schools of minnows, one school sends
datums, the other set receives them.  Each school may contain one or
more minnows, as defined by the <A HREF = "bait_school.html">school</A> command.
Since a datum is typically sent from a single minnow to a single
receiving minnow, the style of the hook determines which minnow in the
sending schoold communicates with which minnow in the receiving
school.
</P>
<P>Each minnow can send datums through specific output ports.  If a
minnow defines N output ports, then they are numbered 0 to N-1.
Likewise a minnow can receive data through specific input ports.  If a
minnow defines M input ports, then they are numbered 0 to M-1.  Ports
enable a minnow to have multiple input and output hooks, and for a
PHISH input script to hook a single set of minnows to multiple other
sets of minnows with different communication patterns.  For example, a
stream of data might be processed by a minnow, reading from its input
port 0, and writing to its output port 0.  But the minnow might also
look for incoming datums on its input port 1, that signify some kind
of external message from a "control" minnow triggered by the user,
e.g. asking the minnow to print out its current statistics.  See the
<A HREF = "Minnows.html">Minnows</A> doc page for more information about how minnows
can define and use ports.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>sendID</I> and <I>outport</I> are the minnows which will send
datums through their output port <I>outport</I>.  If <I>outport</I> is not
specified with a colon following the <I>sendID</I>, then a default output
port of 0 is assumed.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>recvID</I> and <I>inport</I> are the minnows which will receive
the sent datums through their input port <I>inport</I>.  If <I>inport</I> is not
specified with a colon following the <I>recvID</I>, then a default input
port of 0 is assumed.
</P>
<P>Both <I>sendID</I> and <I>recvID</I> must be the IDs of minnows previously
defined by a <A HREF = "bait_minnow.html">minnow</A> command.
</P>
<P>Note that there can be multiple hook commands which hook the same
<I>sendID</I> and same (or different) <I>outport</I> to different
<I>recvID:inport</I> minnows.  Likewise, there can be multiple hook
commands which hook the same <I>recvID</I> and same (or different) <I>inport</I>
to different <I>sendID:outport</I> minnows.  There can even be multiple
hook commands which hook the same <I>sendID</I> and same (or different)
<I>outport</I> to the same <I>recvID:inport</I> minnows.
</P>
<P>Also note that for all of the styles (except as noted below), the
<I>sendID</I> and <I>recvID</I> can be the same, meaning a set of minnows will
send datums to themselves.
</P>
<HR>

<P>These are the different hook styles supported by the
hook command.
</P>
<P>The <I>single</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to one receiving
minnow.  <I>N</I> = 1 is allowed.  All the sending minnows send
their datums to a single receiving minnow.
</P>
<P>The <I>paired</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to <I>N</I> receiving
minnows.  <I>N</I> = 1 is allowed.  Each of the <I>N</I> sending minnows
sends it datums to a specific partner receiving minnow.
</P>
<P>The <I>hashed</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to <I>M</I> receiving
minnows.  <I>N</I> does not have to equal <I>M</I>, and either or both of <I>N</I>,
<I>M</I> = 1 is allowed.  When any of the <I>N</I> minnows sends a datum, it
must also define a value for the PHISH library to hash on, which will
determine which of the <I>M</I> receiving minnows it is sent to.  See the
doc page for the <A HREF = "phish_send.html">phish_send_hashed()</A> library
function for more explanation of how this is done.
</P>
<P>The <I>roundrobin</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to <I>M</I> receiving
minnows.  <I>N</I> does not have to equal <I>M</I>, and either or both of <I>N</I>,
<I>M</I> = 1 is allowed.  Each of the <I>N</I> senders cycles through the list
of <I>M</I> receivers each time it sends a datum, in a roundrobin fashion.
a different.  If the receivers are numbered 0 to M-1, a sender will
send its first datum to 0, its 2nd to 1, its Mth to M-1, its M+1 datum
to 0, etc.
</P>
<P>The <I>direct</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to <I>M</I> receiving
minnows.  <I>N</I> does not have to equal <I>M</I>, and either or both of <I>N</I>,
<I>M</I> = 1 is allowed.  When any of the <I>N</I> minnows sends a datum, it
must also choosed a specific one of the <I>M</I> receiving minnows to sent
to.  See the doc page for the <A HREF = "phish_send.html">phish_send_direct()</A>
library function for more explanation of how this is done.
</P>
<P>The <I>bcast</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to <I>M</I> receiving
minnows.  <I>N</I> does not have to equal <I>M</I>, and either or both of <I>N</I>,
<I>M</I> = 1 is allowed.  When any of the <I>N</I> minnows sends a datum, it
sends a copy of it once to each of the <I>M</I> receiving minnows.
</P>
<P>The <I>chain</I> style configures <I>N</I> minnows as a 1-dimensional chain so
that each minnow sends datums to the next minnow in the chain, and
likewise each minnow receives datums from the previous minnow in the
chain.  The first minnow in the chain cannot receive, and the last
minnow in the chain cannot send. <I>N</I> > 1 is required.  The <I>sendID</I>
must also be the same as the <I>recvID</I>, since the same set of minnows
is sending and receiving.
</P>
<P>The <I>ring</I> style is the same as the <I>chain</I> style, except that the <I>N</I>
minnows are configured as a 1-dimensional loop.  Each minnow sends
datums to the next minnow in the loop, and likewise each minnow
receives datums from the previous minnow in the loop.  This includes
the first and last minnows.  <I>N</I> > 1 is required.  The <I>sendID</I> must
also be the same as the <I>recvID</I>, since the same set of minnows is
sending and receiving.
</P>
<P>TIM: are these enabled yet for any of the backends?
</P>
<P>The <I>publish</I> and <I>subscribe</I> styles are different in that they do not
hook two sets of minnows to each other.  Instead they hook one
set of minnows to an external socket, either for writing or reading
datums.  The external socket will typically be driven by some external
program which is either reading from the socket or writing to it, but
the running PHISH program requires no knowledge of that program.  It
could be another PHISH program or some completely different program.
</P>
<P>The <I>publish</I> style hooks <I>N</I> sending minnows to a socket.  <I>N</I> = 1
is allowed.  The <I>recvID:inport</I> argument is replaced with a TCP port
#, which is an integer, e.g. 25.  When each minnow sends a datum it
will "publish" the bytes of the datum to that TCP port, on the machine
the minnow is running on.  In socket lingo, "publishing" means that
the sender has no communication with any processes which may be
reading from the socket.  The sender simply writes the bytes and
continues without blocking.  If no process is reading from the socket,
the datum is lost.
</P>
<P>The <I>subscribe</I> style hooks <I>M</I> receiving minnows to a socket.  <I>M</I>
= 1 is allowed.  The <I>sendID:outport</I> argument is replaced with a
hostname and TCP port #, separated by a colon, e.g. www.foo.com:25.
Each minnow receives datums by "subscribing" to the TCP port on the
specified host.  In socket lingo, "subscribing" means that the
receiver has no communication with any process which is writing to the
socket.  The receiver simply checks if a datum is available and reads
it.  If a new datum arrives before the receiver is ready to read it,
the datum is lost.
</P>
<P>Note that multple processes can publish to the same physical socket,
and likewise multiple processes can subscribe to the same physical
socket.  In the latter case, each receiving process reads the same
published datum.
</P>
<P>TIM: how does the PHISH library check the socket and return
if there is no datum, e.g. for phish_loop ?  or do you
have to use phish_probe() ?
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>TIM: is this true?
</P>
<P>The <I>publish</I> and <I>subscribe</I> styles are only supported by the socket
version of the PHISH library, not the MPI version.
