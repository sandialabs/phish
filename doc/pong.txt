pong minnow :h3

[Syntax:]

pong :pre

this minnow takes no arguments :ul

[Examples:]

pong :pre

[Description:]

Pong is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the "PHISH library"_Library.html to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows via its input and output ports.

The pong minnow is designed for use with the "ping"_ping.hmtl
minnow, to exchange datums back and forth.

[Ports:]

The pong minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one output
port 0 to send datums.

[Operation:]

When it starts, the pong minnow calls the "phish_loop"_phish_recv.html
function.  Each time a datum is received on input port 0 (i.e. from
the ping minnow), it is re-sent to output port 0.

The pong minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.

[Data:]

The pong minnow does not care what kinds of datums it receives and
re-sends.

[Restrictions:]

The default buffer size for sending and receiving datums is 1 Kbyte.
To use an {M} value that exceeds this, use the "set memory" command
should be used in the PHISH input script so that the PHISH library
allocates larger buffers.
