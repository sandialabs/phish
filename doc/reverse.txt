[Description:]

Echo is a stand-alone program.  Unlike other PHISH minnows in the
minnows directory of the PHISH distribution, it is not a program that
needs to be linked with the PHISH library.  It is provided for
illustration purposed, because it can be wrapped with the
"wrapss"_wrapss.html minnow so that can it be used as one of a school
of minnows in a PHISH program.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a
stand-alone application which makes calls to the "PHISH
library"_Library.html to exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
