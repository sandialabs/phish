[Description:]

These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In "PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the "PHISH
library"_Library.html.

These functions are used to query and reset information stored
internally in PHISH.  New keywords may be added as usage cases arise.

:line

For phish_query, the "idlocal", "nlocal", "idglobal", and "nglobal"
keywords return info about the minnow and its relation to other
minnows running the PHISH program.  These keywords ignore the flag1
and flag2 values; they can simply be set to 0.

A PHISH program typically includes one or more sets of minnows, as
specified in a PHISH input script.  Each minnow in each set is an
individual process.  In a local sense, each minnow has a local-ID from
0 to Nlocal-1 within its set, where {Nlocal} is the number of minnows
in the set.  Globally, each minnow has a global-ID from 0 to
Nglobal-1, where {Nglobal} is the total number of minnows.  The
global-IDs are ordered by set, so that minnows within each set have
consecutive IDs.  These IDs enable the PHISH library to orchestrate
communication of datums between minnows in different sets.  E.g. when
running the MPI version of the PHISH library, the global-ID
corresponsds to the rank ID of an MPI process, used in MPI_Send() and
MPI_Recv() function calls.

:line

For phish_query, the "inport/status", "inport/nconnect", and
"inport/nminnows" keywords return info about the input ports that
connect to the minnow by which it receives datums from other minnows.
Likewise, the "outport/status", "outport/nconnect", "output/nminnows",
and "output/direct" keywords return info about the output ports the
minnow connects to by which it sends datums to other minnows.

All of these keywords require the use of {flag1} to specify the input
or output port, which is a number from 0 to Maxport-1.  Some of them,
as noted below, require the use of {flag2} to specify the connection
#, which is a number from 0 to Nconnect-1.

See "this section"_Section_minnows.html_#minnow_3 of the "PHISH
Minnows"_Section_minnows.html doc page for more information about
input and output ports.

See the "connect"_bait_connect.html command which is processed by the
"bait.py"_Section_bait.html tool in a PHISH input script, to
establish connections between sets of minnows.

The "status" keyword returns the status of the port, which
is one of the following values:

unused = 0
open = 1
closed = 2 :ul

The "nconnect" keyword returns the number of sets of minnows that are
connected to a port.

The "nminnows" keyword returns the number of minnows connected
to a port thru a specific connection, as specified by flag2.

The "outport/direct" keyword returns the number of minnows connected
to an output port thru a connection of style {direct}.  The first
such connection found is used to return this value, so if another
{direct} connection is desired, the "outport/nminnows" keyword
should be used.

See the "phish_send_direct"_phish_send.html function for a discussion
of how datums are sent via {direct} style connections, and why this
particular phish_query() keyword can be useful.

:line

For phish_set, the "ring/receiver" keyword changes the minnow that
this minnow sends messages to.  This keyword can only be used when the
minnow is part of school of minnows that is exchanging datums via a
"ring" connection; see the "connect"_bait_connect.html command in
PHISH input scripts that defines the ring connection.  This keyword
can be used to effectively permute the ordering of the minnows in the
ring.

For ring/receiver, {flag1} is the output port number.  {Flag2} is the
new receiving minnow to send datums to on that port.  It should be a
value from 0 to Nring-1 inclusive, where Nring = the # of minnows in
the ring.
