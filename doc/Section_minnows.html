<H3>3. PHISH Minnows 
</H3>
<P>In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow" is a
stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A>.  Minnows are typically small programs which
perform a single task, e.g. they parse a string searcing for keywords
and store statistics about those keywords.  But they can also be large
programs which perform sophisticated computations and make only
occasional calls to the PHISH library.  In which case they should
probably be called "sharks" or "whales" ...
</P>
<P>An individual minnow is part of a "school" of one or more duplicate
minnows.  One or more schools form a PHISH "net(work)" which compute
in a coordinated fashion to perform a calculation.  Minnows
communicate with each other to exchange data via calls to the PHISH
library.

<A NAME = "minnow_2"></A><H4>3.2 Code structure of a minnow 
</H4>
<P>The easiest way to understand how a minnow works with the PHISH
library, is to examine a few simple files in the minnow directory.
Here we list the count.py minnow, which is written in Python.  There
is a also a count.cpp minnow, written in C++, which does the same
thing.  The purpose of this minnow is to count occurrences of strings
that it receives as datums:
</P>
<PRE>1   #!/usr/local/bin/python as path to Python if desired
2
3   import sys
4   import phish
5
6   def count(nvalues):
7     if nvalues != 1: phish.error("Count processes one-value datums")
8     type,str,tmp = phish.unpack()
9     if type != phish.STRING:
10      phish.error("Count processes string values")
11    if hash.has_key(str): hash<B>str</B> = hash<B>str</B> + 1
12    else: hash<B>str</B> = 1
13
14  def dump():
16    for key,value in hash.items():
17      phish.pack_int(value)
18      phish.pack_string(key)
19      phish.send(0)
20
21  args = phish.init(sys.argv)
22  phish.input(0,count,dump,1)
23  phish.output(0)
24  phish.check()
25
26  if len(args) != 0: phish.error("Count syntax: count")
27
28  hash = <I></I>
29  
30  phish.loop()
31  phish.exit() 
</PRE>
<P>On line 4, the Python minnow imports the phish module, which is
provided with the PHISH distribution.  Instructions on how to use this
module, which wraps the C-interface to the PHISH library, are given in
<A HREF = "Section_python.html">this section</A> of the documentation.
</P>
<P>The main program begins on line 21.  The call to the
<A HREF = "phish_init.html">phish.init</A> is typically the first line of a PHISH
minnow.  When the minnow is launched, extra PHISH library command-line
arguments are added which describe how the minnow will communicate
with other minnows.  These are stripped off by the
<A HREF = "phish_init.html">phish.init</A> function, and the remaining
minnow-specific arguments are returned as "args".  The
<A HREF = "phish.input.html">phish.input</A> and <A HREF = "phish.output.html">phish.output</A>
functions setup the input and output ports used by the minnow.  A port
is a communication channel by which datums arrive from other minnows
or can be sent to other minnows.  The PHISH input script sets up these
connections, but from the minnow's perspective, it simply receives
datums on its input port(s) and writes datums to its output port(s).
See the <A HREF = "#minnow_3">next section</A> for more discussion of ports.
</P>
<P>There should be one call to <A HREF = "phish.input.html">phish.input</A> for each
input port the minnow uses.  And one call to
<A HREF = "phish.output.html">phish.output</A> for each output port it uses. The
call to the <A HREF = "phish.check.html">phish.check</A> function on line 24 insures
that the minnow as written is compatible with the way it is used in
the PHISH input script, i.e. that the necessary input and output ports
have been defined with valid <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook styles</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "phish.input.html">phish.input</A> call specifies a callback function
that the PHISH library will invoke when a datum arrives on that input
port.  In this case, the count minnow defines a count() callback
function which stores a received string in a hash table (Python
dictionary) with an associated count of the number of times it has
been received.
</P>
<P>On line 28, an empty hash table is initialized, and then the
<A HREF = "phish.loop.html">phish.loop</A> function is called.  This gives control
to the PHISH library, which will wait for datums to be received,
invoking the appropriate callback function each time one arrives.
</P>
<P>The call to <A HREF = "phish.input.html">phish.input</A> also defines a callback to
the dump() function which is invoked when input port 0 is closed.
This occurs when upstream minnows send the requisite number of "done"
messages to the port.  The dump() function sends the contents of the
hash table to output port 0, one datum at a time.  Each datum contains
a unique string and its count.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "phish.loop.html">phish.loop</A> function returns after invoking
dump() and when all input ports are closed.  The count minnow then
calls the <A HREF = "phish.exit.html">phish.exit</A> function which will close its
output port(s), and send "done" messages to downstream minnows
connected to those ports.
</P>
<P>This code structure is typical of many minnows:
</P>
<UL><LI>A beginnning section with a call to <A HREF = "phish.init.html">phish.init</A>,
definitions of input/output ports, and a call to
<A HREF = "phish.check.html">phish.check</A>.  Then a call to
<A HREF = "phish.loop.html">phish.loop</A> or <A HREF = "phish.probe.html">phish.probe</A> or
<A HREF = "phish.recv.html">phish.recv</A> to receive datums.  This is unnecessary
if the minnow only generates datums, i.e. it is a source of data, but
not a consumer of data. 

<LI>One or more callback functions unpack datums via the
<A HREF = "phish.unpack.html">phish.unpack</A> function, process their content,
store state, and send messsages via <A HREF = "phish.pack.html">phish.pack</A> and
<A HREF = "phish.send.html">phish.send</A> functions. 

<LI>After <A HREF = "phish.loop.html">phish.loop</A> exits, the minnow shuts down via a
call to <A HREF = "phish.close.html">phish.close</A> or <A HREF = "phish.exit.html">phish.exit</A>
and terminates. See <A HREF = "#minnow_4">this section</A> for more discussion of
shut down procedures. 
</UL>
<HR>

<A NAME = "minnow_3"></A><H4>3.3 Communication via ports 
</H4>
<P>As discussed above, ports are input/output communication channels by
which a minnow receives datums from an upstream minnow or sends datums
to a downstream minnow.
</P>
<P>The number of ports that can be configured by a minnow varies between PHISH
library backends.  The ZMQ version of the library supports an unlimited number
of input and output ports, while the MPI version of the library supports up to
MAXPORT number of input ports and MAXPORT number of output ports.  MAXPORT is a
hardwired value in src/phish-mpi.cpp which is set to 16.  It can be changed if
needed, but note that all minnows which use the MPI version of the library must
be re-built since they must all use a consistent value of MAXPORT when run
together in a PHISH net.
</P>
<P>Note that a PHISH input script may connect a particular minnow to
other minnows in a variety of ways.  This applies to both the <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">styles
of hooks</A> that are specified and the number of minnows
on the other end of each hook.  Thus it is possible for the user to
specify hooks in the input script which the minnow does not support or
even define.  Similarly, the input script may cause other minnows to
send datums to the minnow which it does not expect or is unable to
interpret.  This means a minnow should be coded to follow these rules:
</P>
<UL><LI>It should define each input port it receives datums on as "required"
or "optional", via the <A HREF = "phish.input.html">phish.input</A> function.  This
will generate erros if the PHISH input script is incompatible with the
minnow. 

<LI>It should define each output port it sends datums to, via the
<A HREF = "phish.output.html">phish.output</A> function.  This will also generate
errors for incompatible PHISH input scripts, though the use of output
ports by a script is always optional. 

<LI>The minnow should check the number of fields and data type of each
field it receives, if it expects to receive datums of a specified
structure and data type. 

<LI>If feasible, the minnow should be coded in a general manner to work
with different kinds of datums and data types, so that it can be used
in a variety of PHISH input scripts 

<LI>Which port a datum arrived on is the only attribute of a received
datum that a minnow can query (other than the format and content of
the datum itself); see the <A HREF = "phish.datum.html">phish.datum</A> function.
It cannot query which minnow sent it via what output port or which
connection to the input port it arrived by.  This is because these are
really settings determined by the PHISH input script, and the minnow
should not depend on them.  If such info is really necessary for the
minnow to know, then it can be encoded as a field in the datum itself,
so the minnow can extract it. 
</UL>
<P>Here are other flexible attributes of input and output ports to note,
all enabled by the <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> command in a PHISH input
script:
</P>
<UL><LI>A single input port can receive datums from multiple other schools of
minnows and multiple output ports. 

<LI>A single output port can send datums to multiple other schools of
minnows and multiple input ports.  This means an individual datum may
be sent multiple times to different minnows. 

<LI>A minnow can send datums via its output port to its own input
port. 
</UL>
<P>All of these scenarios can be setup by appropriate use of
<A HREF = "bait.html">hook</A> commands in a PHISH input script.
</P>
<P>An additional issue to consider is whether a communication channel can
be saturated or drop datums.  Imagine a PHISH net where one minnow
sends datums at a high rate to a receiving minnow, which cannot
process them as fast as they are sent.  Over time, the receiving
minnow is effectively a bottleneck in processing a stream of data.
The PHISH library will not lose messages in this scenario, rather the
overall processing pipeline naturally throttles itself to the rate of
the bottlenecking minnow.  This is handled by the underlying MPI or
socket message passing protocols.  ZMQ handles this naturally.  In the
case of MPI, the sending and receiving processes coordinate data
exchanges.  By default this is done via MPI_Send() and MPI_Recv()
calls.  If you get a run-time MPI error about dropping messages, then
you should use occasionally use the "safe" mode of data exchange which
can be enabled by the <A HREF = "bait_set.html">set safe</A> command in a PHISH
input script or "--set safe" command-line option.  This will use
MPI_Ssend() calls which enforce extra handshaking between the sending
and receiving processes to avoid dropping messages.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "minnow_4"></A><H4>3.4 Shutting down a minnow 
</H4>
<P>PHISH minnows can be designed to process a finite or infinite stream of data.
In the infininte case, the PHISH net of minnows is typically shut down by the
user killing one or more of the processes.  Note that the current ZMQ version
of PHISH cannot guarantee that all processes will be shut-down cleanly.  You
may need to kill some of the procsses manually.
</P>
<P>In the finite case, you typically want each minnow in the net to shut
down cleanly.
</P>
<P>The PHISH library sends special "done" messages when a minnow closes
one of its output ports.  This is triggered by a call to the
<A HREF = "phish_close.html">phish_close</A> function, which closes a single port,
or the <A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A> function which closes all output
ports.  A "done message is sent to each receiving minnow of each input
port connected to the corresponding output port.  The receiving minnow
counts these messages as they arrive.  When it has received one "done"
message from every minnow that connects to one of its input ports, it
closes the input port and the library calls back to the minnow (if a
callback function was defined by the <A HREF = "phish_input.html">phish_input</A>
function).  When all its input ports have been closed it makes an
additional callback to the minnow (if a callback function was defined
by the <A HREF = "phish_callback.html">phish_callback</A> function).
</P>
<P>This mechanism is often sufficient to trigger an orderly shutdown of
an entire PHISH net by all its minnows, if the most upstream minnow
initiates the process by closing its output ports via a call to
<A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A>.  Exceptions are when a school of minnows
exchanges data in a "ring" style of commuication as setup by the <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook
ring</A> command in a PHISH input script.
</P>
<P>In case of the ring, if the first minnow in the ring invokes the
phish_exit function, it will no longer be receiving datums when the
last minnow in the ring attempts to send it a "done" message.  In this
case, the first minnow should instead invoke
<A HREF = "phish_close.html">phish_close</A> on the output port for the ring, then
wait to receive its final "done" message before calling
<A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A>.
</P>
<P>Another exception is when minnows send datums to themselves in a
looping fashion.  In this case, you typically to include code in
callback functions invoked when "done" messages are received to handle
the shutdown logic.  See the minnow/tri.py for an example of how this
can be done.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "minnow_5"></A><H4>3.5 Building minnows 
</H4>
<P>Minnows are stand-alone programs which simply need to be linked with
the PHISH library.  New single-file minnows written in C or C++ can be
added to the minnow directory of the PHISH distribution and built in
the following manner; minnows written in Python do not need to be
built.
</P>
<P>The easiest way to build all of PHISH, including the PHISH minnows,
is to use the cross-platform <A HREF = "http://www.cmake.org">CMake</A> build system.  We
recommend building PHISH with a separate build directory:
</P>
<PRE>$ tar xzvf phish.tar.gz -C ~/src
$ mkdir ~/build/phish
$ cd ~/build/phish
$ ccmake ~/src/phish-14sep12 
</PRE>
<P>Then, in the CMake curses interface, configure the build, generate makefiles,
and build phish:
</P>
<PRE>$ make 
</PRE>
<P>Note that if you add a new minnow to the minnow directory, simply re-run ccmake
regenerate makefiles, and build - your minnow will automatically be
incorporated into the build.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Alternatively, typing the following from the minnow directory will build all C
and C++ minnows:
</P>
<PRE>make machine 
</PRE>
<P>where machine is the suffix of one of the provided Makefiles,
e.g. linux.mpi or linux.zmq.  Type "make" to see a list of the
different files and what compiler and MPI options they support.
</P>
<P>The ".mpi" or ".zmq" suffix of the make target and associated
Makefile refer to which version of the PHISH library will
be linked against, either the MPI or ZMQ version.
</P>
<P>The make command also builds non-PHISH C or C++ programs which are
intended to be wrapped with one of the "wrap" minnows discussed above
so they can be used as a minnow.  Examples are the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo</A>
and <A HREF = "reverse.html">reverse</A> programs in the minnow directory.
</P>
<P>If none of the provided Makefiles are a match to your machine, you can
use one of them as a template and create your own.  Note that only the
top section for compiler/linker settings need be edited.  This is
where you should specify your compiler and linker and any switches
they use.  For the LIB setting, be sure to use the appropriate version
of the PHISH library you are linking to, i.e. libphish-mpi.so or
libphish-zmq.so.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When adding a new minnow that is a single file to the
minnow directory, you should insure the string "MINNOW" appears
somewhere in the *.cpp or *.c file.  This is how the top-level
minnow/Makefile includes it in the build list.  It will then be
automatically built with the other minnows.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you wish to switch the PHISH library used with your
minnows (MPI vs ZMQ), you should type "make clean-all" and then
re-compile and re-link all the minnows.  You can also type "make
clean" to simply delete all object files.
</P>
<P>If your new minnow is complex enough to consist of multiple files, you
can add a specific rule for how to build it to the Makefile.machine
you use, e.g. that defines a new target with a list of OBJ files that
it depends on.  Or you can build it in a separate directory with your
own custom Makefile, so long as you link to the PHISH library, similar
to how the Makefiles in the minnow directory perform the final link
step.
</P>
<P>Your executable minnow files do not need to be added to the minnow
directory.  See the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html#bait_3">--path command-line
switch</A> for the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A>
tool for how to access minnows from other directories when running a
PHISH net.
