<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It resets
default values that are used by the bait.py program as it reads and
processes commands from the PHISH input script.
</P>
<P>The <I>memory</I> keyword sets the maximum length of datums that are
exchanged by minnows when a PHISH program runs.  Send and receive
buffers for datums are allocated by the <A HREF = "Section_library.html">PHISH
library</A>.  Only 2 such buffers are allocated, so
this setting essentially determines the memory footprint of the PHISH
library.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> setting is in Kbytes, so that <I>N</I> = 1024 is 1 Mbyte, and <I>N</I> =
1048576 is 1 Gbyte.  The default is <I>N</I> = 1, since typical PHISH
minnows send and receive small datums.
</P>
<P>The <I>safe</I> keyword is only relevant for the MPI version of the PHISH
library.  It causes the library to use a "safe" MPI_Ssend() call every
Mth time it sends a datum, rather than the normal MPI_Send() function.
If M = 0, "safe" sends are never performed.
</P>
<P>Safe in this context refers to messages being dropped if the receiving
process is backed up.  This can happen if a minnow in a PHISH school
of minnows is significantly slower to process datums than all the
others, and a large number of datums are being continually sent to it.
When a safe send is done, an extra handshake is performed between the
sender and receiver to insure the receiver is ready for the datum.
Doing this often enough should effectively throttle the incoming
messages to a slow minnow, so an overflow does not occur.  Note that
the extra handshaking between the MPI processes slows down the rate at
which small messages are exchanged, so you should not normally use
this setting unless MPI errors arise, e.g. due to "too many unexpected
messages".  A good setting for M depends on how many minnows are
sending to the overflowing minnow.  Typical MPI implementations allow
tens of thousands of small incoming messages to be queued, so M = 1000
or 10000 is fine if a single minnow is sending to the minnow.  If 10
minnows are sending to the overflowing minnow, then M should be
reduced by a factor of 10.
