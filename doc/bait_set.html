<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It resets
default values that are used by the bait.py program as it reads and
processes commands from the PHISH input script.
</P>
<P>The <I>memory</I> keyword sets the maximum length of datums that are
exchanged by minnows when a PHISH program runs.  Send and receive
buffers for datums are allocated by the <A HREF = "Section_library.html">PHISH
library</A>.  Only 2 such buffers are allocated, so
this setting essentially determines the memory footprint of the PHISH
library.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> setting is in Kbytes, so that <I>N</I> = 1024 is 1 Mbyte, and <I>N</I> =
1048576 is 1 Gbyte.  The default is <I>N</I> = 1, since typical PHISH
minnows send and receive small datums.
</P>
<P>The <I>safe</I> keyword is only relevant the MPI version of the PHISH
library.  It forces the library to use MPI_Ssend() calls which are a
safer version than the normal MPI_Send() function.  Safe in this
context refers to messages being dropped if the receiving process is
backed up.  This can happen if a minnow in a PHISH school of minnows
is significantly slower to process datums than all the others, and a
large number of datums are being continually sent to it.  With the
safe mode of MPI calls, the slow minnow should effectively throttle
the incoming messages so an overflow does not occur.  This requires
extra handshaking between the MPI processes and slows down the rate at
which small messages are exchanged, so this safe mode is "off" by
default.  Many PHISH programs do not seem to need it, as MPI is
robust enough to insure no messages are dropped.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>safe</I> keyword takes no value.  If it is not specified,
the default is for the PHISH library to use normal MPI_Send() calls.
