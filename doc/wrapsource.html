<UL><LI>-f = optional flag for substituting input datums into "program"

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Wrapsource is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In
<A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>The wrapsource minnow is used to wrap a non-PHISH application so that
the lines it writes to stdout can be sent as datums to other PHISH
minnows.  It is a mechanism for using non-PHISH applications as
minnows in a PHISH net.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The wrapsource minnow uses one input port 0 if the -f flag is
specified, otherwise it uses no input ports.  It uses one output port
0 to send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>The wrapsource minnow has two modes of operation, depending on whether
the -f flag is specified.  In either case, the <I>program</I> argument is
treated as a string that is executed as a command by the shell.
</P>
<P>As in the examples above <I>program</I> can be any string with flags or
redirection operators.  If the string contains spaces, it should be
enclosed in quotes in the PHISH input script so that it is treated as
a single argument when the script is read by the
<A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.
</P>
<P>If no -f flag is specified, the wrapsouce minnow launches a single
instance of the <I>program</I> command and reads the output it writes to
stdout a line at a time.
</P>
<P>If the -f flag is specified, the wrapsouce minnow calls the
<A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> function.  Each time an input datum is
received, its single string field is inserted in the <I>program</I> string,
as a replacement for a "%s" that it is presumed to contain.  This can
be used, for example, to substitute a filename into the <I>program</I>
string.  The wrapsource minnow then launches the modified <I>program</I>
command and reads the output it generates.  When the program exits,
control returns to <A HREF = "phish_loop.html">phish_loop</A>, and a new datum can
be received.  Thus over time, the wrapsource minnow may launch many
instances of <I>program</I>.
</P>
<P>Each time a line of output is read from the running <I>program</I> the
wrapsource minnow sends it as a string (without the trailing newline)
to its output port 0.
</P>
<P>If no -f flag is specified, the wrapsource minnow calls
<A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A> after the launched program exits.  If -f
is specified, the wrapsource minnow shuts down when its input port is
closed by receiving a sufficient number of "done" messages.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>If the -f flag is specified, the count minnow must receive single
field datums of type PHISH_STRING.  It sends single-field datums of
type PHISH_STRING.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The C++ version of the wrapsouce minnow allocates a buffer of size
MAXLINE = 1024 bytes for reading lines of output written to stdout by
the wrapped program.  This can be changed (by editing
minnow/wrapsource.cpp) if longer lines are needed.
