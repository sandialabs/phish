<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Ping is a PHISH minnow that can be used as one of a school of minnows
in a PHISH program.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>wrap a child process which creates datums by writing to stdout
</P>
<P>syntax: wrapsource -f "program"
-f is optional
</P>
<P>if -f is specified, receive filenames in stream and
  invoke child process on each filename
  generate "program" via sprintf() using filename as arg
  so "program" presumably has %s in it
if -f is not specified, invoke child process just once using "program"
</P>
<P>"program" can be any string with flags, redirection, etc
enclose in quotes to prevent shell from processing it
</P>
<P>read lines of output from child one by one as datums via a pipe
send them downstream
</P>
<P>for each datum:
  launch the child process on the filename
  read all its output until child exits
  send each line of output downstream vis phish_send w/out newline
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

<P>Note: set command may be required to boost buffer size
