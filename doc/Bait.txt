2. Bait.py Tool :h3

Bait.py is a Python program which converts a PHISH input script into a
configuration file that can be launched via MPI or a shell script, so
as to run a school of minnows in parallel on many processors, i.e. to
run as a PHISH program and perform a calculation.  A minnow is simply
PHISH-speak for an independent process, created by running one
instance of a stand-alone program.

You can edit the input script or pass it different parameters via
command-line arguments to bait.py to change the calculation.
Rerunning bait.py will create a new launch script.

The remainder of this page discusses how bait.py is used and how a
PHISH input script is formatted.  The PHISH input script commands
recognized by bait.py have their own doc pages.

Running bait.py :link(bait_1),h4

The bait.py Python script is in the bait directory of the PHISH
distribution.

Like any Python script you can run it in one of two ways:

bait.py -switch value(s) ... < in.script
python bait.py -switch values ... < in.script :pre

For the first case, you need to insure that the first
line of bait.py gives the correct path to the Python
installed on your machine, e.g.

#!/usr/local/bin/python :pre

and that the bait.py file is executable, e.g.

chmod +x bait.py :pre

Normally you will want to invoke bait.py from the directory
where your PHISH input script is, so you may need to
prepend bait.py with a path or make an alias for running it.

The switch/value command-line arguments recognized by bait.py are
discussed in the next section.

:line

Command-line arguments :link(bait_2),h4

These are the command-line arguments recognized by bait.py.  Each is
specified as "-switch value(s)".  Each switch has an abbreviated form;
several of them have default settings.

-var or -v | -var name str1 str2 ...
-out or -o | -out filename
-path or -p | -path dir1:dir2:dir3:...
-mode or -m | -mode outstyle :tb(s=|)

The {-var} switch defines a variable that can be used within the
script.  It can be used multiple times to define different variables.
A "variable"_bait_variable.html command can also be used in the input
script itself.  The variable name is any alphanumeric string.  A list
of strings is assigned to it, e.g. a series of filenames.  For
example,

bait.py -v files *.cpp < in.phish :pre

creates the variable named "files" containing a list of all CPP files
in the current directory.

The {-out} switch specifies a filename that bait.py will create when
it writes out the MPI or socket script that can be used to launch the
PHISH program.  The default value is "outfile".

The {-path} switch specifies a colon-separated list of directories,
which are added to an internal list stored by bait.py.  Initially the
list contains only the current working directory.  When bait.py
processes each minnow, as specified by the "minnow"_bait_minnow.html
command, it looks for the minnow's executable file in the list of
directories, so that it can write it to the launch script with a full,
correct path name.  This switch can be used multiple times, adding
more directories each time.

The {-mode} switch specifies the format of the launch file that
bait.py writes out.  The valid {outstyle} values are {mpich} or
{openmpi} or {socket}.  {Mpich} is the default.

Input script syntax and parsing :link(bait_3),h4

A PHISH input script is a text file that contains commands, typically
one per line.

Blank lines are ignored.  Any text following a "#" character is
treated as a comment and removed, including the "#" character.  If the
last printable character in the line is "&", then it is treated as a
continuation character, the next line is appended, and the same
procedure for stripping a "#" comment and checking for a trailing "&"
is repeated.

The resulting command line is then searched for variable references.
A variable with a single-character name, such as "n", can be
referenced as $n.  A variable with a multi-character name (or
single-character name), such as "foo", is referenced as $\{foo\}.
Each variable found in the command line is replaced with the
variable's contents, which is a list of strings, separated by
whitespace.  Thus a variable "files" defined either
by a bait.py command-line argument or the "variable"_bait_variable.html
command as

-v files f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt
variable files f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt :pre

would be substituted for in this command:

minnow 1 filegen $\{files\} :pre

so that the command becomes:

minnow 1 filegen f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt :pre

After variable substitution, a single command is a series of "words"
separated by whitespace.  The first word is the command name; the
reamining words are arguments.

These are the command names recognized by bait.py:

"variable"_bait_variable.html :ulb,l
"set"_bait_set.html :l
"minnow"_bait_minnow.html :l
"connect"_bait_connect.html :l
"layout"_bait_layout.html :ule,l

Each command has its own syntax; see its doc page for details.

With one exception, commands in a PHISH input script can be listed in
any order.  The script is converted by bait.py into a launch script
for running a PHISH program, after the entire script is read.  The
exception is that a variable cannot be substituted for before it is
defined.

Simple example :link(bait_4),h4

"This section"_Intro.html#intro_5 of the "Introduction"_Intro.html doc
page, discussed this diagram of a PHISH calculation for counting the
number of times words appear in a corpus of files, performed as a
streaming MapReduce operation.

:c,image(JPG/wordcount.jpg)

This is the PHISH input script example/in.wc that represents the
diagram:

# word count from files
# provide list of files or dirs as -v files command-line arg :pre

minnow 1 filegen ${files}
minnow 2 file2words
minnow 3 count
minnow 4 sort 10
minnow 5 print :pre

connect 1 roundrobin 2
connect 2 hashed 3
connect 3 single 4
connect 4 single 5 :pre

layout 1 1
layout 2 5
layout 3 3
layout 4 1
layout 5 1 :pre

The "minnow"_bait_minnow.html commands list the 5 different minnows
used.  Note the use of the $\{files\} variable to pass a list
of filenames or directories to the {FileGen} minnow.

The "connect"_bait_connect.html commands specify the communication
pattern used bewteen different sets of minnows.  The key pattern for
this example is the {hashed} style, which allows the {File2Words}
minnow to pass a "key" (a word) to the PHISH library.  The library
hashes the word to determine which {Count} minnow to send the datum
to.

The "layout"_bait_layout.html commands specify how many instances of
each minnow to launch.  Any number of {File2Words} and {Count} minnows
could be specified.

When this script is run thru bait.py in the example directory, as

../bait/bait.py -v files in.* -p ../minnow < in.wc :pre

then bait.py produces the following lines in outfile

-n 1 ../minnow/filegen -minnow filegen 1 1 0 -out 1 0 0 roundrobin 5 1 0 -args in.bottle in.cc in.cc.jon in.filelist in.pp in.rmat in.slow in.wc in.wrapsink in.wrapsource in.wrapsourcefile in.wrapss :
-n 5 ../minnow/file2words -minnow file2words 2 5 1 -in 1 0 0 roundrobin 5 1 0 -out 5 1 0 hashed 3 6 0 :
-n 3 ../minnow/count -minnow count 3 3 6 -in 5 1 0 hashed 3 6 0 -out 3 6 0 single 1 9 0 :
-n 1 ../minnow/sort -minnow sort 4 1 9 -in 3 6 0 single 1 9 0 -out 1 9 0 single 1 10 0 -args 10 :
-n 1 ../minnow/print -minnow print 5 1 10 -in 1 9 0 single 1 10 0 :pre

which is the format of a "configfile" for the MPICH flavor of MPI.
There is one line per minnow, as defined by the input script.  The "-n
N" specifies how many copies of the minnow will be invoked.  The next
argument is the name of the minnow executable.  Several switches like
"-minnow", "-in", "-out" follow which are created by bait.py to encode
the communication patterns between the minnows as represented by the
diagram above and the "connect"_bait_connect.html commands of the
input script.  The final "-args" switch is followed by minnow-specfic
arguments that appeared in the input script.

As discussed in "this section"_Intro.html#intro_5 of the
"Introduction"_Intro.html doc page, this outfile can be launched via
the MPICH mpiexec command as:

mpiexec -configfile outfile :pre

This will launch 11 independent processes as an MPI job.  Each process
will call the PHISH library to exchange datums with other processes in
the pattern indicated in the diagram.  The datum exchanges will be
performed via MPI\Send() and MPI\_Recv() calls since the MPI version
of the PHISH library is being invoked.
