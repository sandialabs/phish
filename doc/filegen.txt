filegen minnow :h3

[Syntax:]

[Description:]

Filegen is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In
"PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows via its input and output ports.

The filegen minnow generates a list of filenames from the filenames
and directory names given to it as arguments.  Each directory is
opened (recursively) and scanned to generate filenames.

[Ports:]

The filegen minnow uses no input ports.  It uses one output port 0 to
send datums.

[Operation:]

When it starts, the filegen minnow loops over its input arguments.  If
the argument is a file, it sends the filename to its output port 0.
If the argument is a directory name, it reads all the filenames in the
directory and sends each one to its output port 0.  If any entry in
the directory is itself a directory, then it recurses and generates
sends additional filenames to its output port 0.

When it has processed all its input arguments, the filegen minnow
calls the "phish_exit"_phish_exit.html function to shut down.

[Data:]

Each datum the filegen minnow sends has a single field of type
PHISH_STRING.

[Restrictions:] none
