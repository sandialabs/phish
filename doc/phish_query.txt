[Description:]

This is a PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html.

This function is used by a minnow to query information about the set
of minnows it belongs to and the global school of minnows running the
PHISH program.  It can also query information about the input and
output ports the minnow is connected to for communicating with other
minnows, and the number of minnows it sends datums to or receives
datums from.

:line

The "idlocal", "nlocal", "idglobal", and "nglobal" keywords return
info about the minnow and its relation to other minnows running the
PHISH program.  These keywords ignore the flag1 and flag2 values; they
can simply be set to 0.

A PHISH program typically includes one or more sets of minnows, as
specified in a PHISH input script.  Each minnow in each set is an
individual process.  In a local sense, each minnow has a local-ID from
0 to Nlocal-1 within its set, where {Nlocal} is the number of minnows
in the set.  Globally, each minnow has a global-ID from 0 to
Nglobal-1, where {Nglobal} is the total number of minnows.  The
global-IDs are ordered by set, so that minnows within each set have
consecutive IDs.  These IDs enable the PHISH library to orchestrate
communication of datums between minnows in different sets.  E.g. when
running the MPI version of the PHISH library, the global-ID
corresponsds to the rank ID of an MPI process, used in MPI_Send() and
MPI_Recv() function calls.

The "inport/status", "inport/nconnect", and "inport/nminnows" keywords
return info about the input ports that connect to the minnow by which
it receives datums from other minnows.  Likewise, the
"outport/status", "outport/nconnect", "output/nminnows", and
"output/direct" keywords return info about the output ports the minnow
connects to by which it sends datums to other minnows.

All of these keywords require the use of {flag1} to specify the input
or output port, which is a number from 0 to Maxport-1.  Some of them,
as noted below, require the use of {flag2} to specify the connection
#, which is a number from 0 to Nconnect-1.

See "this section"_Section_minnows.html_#minnow_3 of the "PHISH
Minnows"_Section_minnows.html doc page for more information about
input and output ports.

See the "connect"_bait_connect.html command which is processed by the
"bait.py"_Section_bait.html tool in a PHISH input script, to
establish connections between sets of minnows.

The "status" keyword returns the status of the port, which
is one of the following values:

unused = 0
open = 1
closed = 2 :ul

The "nconnect" keyword returns the number of sets of minnows that are
connected to a port.

The "nminnows" keyword returns the number of minnows connected
to a port thru a specific connection, as specified by flag2.

The "outport/direct" keyword returns the number of minnows connected
to an output port thru a connection of style {direct}.  The first
such connection found is used to return this value, so if another
{direct} connection is desired, the "outport/nminnows" keyword
should be used.

See the "phish_send_direct"_phish_send.html function for a discussion
of how datums are sent via {direct} style connections, and why this
particular phish_query() keyword can be useful.
