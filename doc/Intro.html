<A NAME = "intro_1"></A><H4>1.1 Motivation 
</H4>
<P>informatics, data-driven computing becoming more prevalent, 
even on large-scale parallel machines
</P>
<P>what is streaming data
 continuous
 high bandwidth
 cannot afford to see it more than once
</P>
<P>goals: informatics data in broadest sense, stats, data mininng,
 anomaly detection
</P>
<P>powerful paradigm: stateful independent processes, that
 are small programs that do one things, run a large collection
 of these that communicate is a designed fashion, to acheive
 parallelism, running
 that ship datums (chunk of bytes) to each other in continuous
 fashion.  Can be infinite stream or processing of large
 archive of data
</P>
<P>what kind of algorithms can be expressed in this mode?
various stream models of computation: e.g. W-stream, X-stream
our own interest is graph algorithms and data mining on 
hi-volume streams of data, but many other data processing
tasks can be formulated in this fashion
</P>
<P>other products: DataMiner from IBM (see Karl list)
</P>
<P>dropping data versus perfrect answer (pipeline throttles itself)
</P>
<P>why we wrote PHISH
 different than typicaly MPI where all procs run one program
 wanted to go beyond MPI to sockets, hetergenous machines
   add/delete minnows dynamically
 wanted to automate some of the parallelism inherent in 
   processing big data, a la MapReduce (this is the hashing idea)
 make it as simple as possible to process data in parallel
</P>
<P>all of these goals reflected in name PHISH
</P>

</P>
<P>portable open-source lib, lightweight, easy to call
from any language, including Python
</P>
<P>easy path to distributed memory parallel for processing

</P>
<P>The PHISH package is open-source software that implements the
<A HREF = "wiki">MapReduce operation</A> popularized by Google on top of standard
MPI message passing.
</P>
<HR>

<P>1.3 PHISH lingo:link(intro_3),h4
</P>
<P>phish wrapper
</P>
<P>Minnows read (swim in) stream, process datums,
can store state, consume or write (altered) datums.
</P>
<P>minnow = stand-alone program (app) that (typically)
does one task, designed to work in tandem with other
minnows, either copies of itself, or totally different
</P>
<P>School of minnows and their connectivity specified
in simple input script, processed with bait.py to
turn into launchable parallel job, either via MPI and
mpirun, or via sockets and a shell script.
</P>
<P>each stand-alone minnow calls library
</P>
<P>ulterior motive, phish swim in a stream, minnows 
are small, but work in coordinated fashion to some
goal (evade preadtor, find food)
</P>
<P>brings us to PHISH lingo
</P>
<P>minnow: read and compute on and write (altered) datums
school: collection of minnows
bait the hook via bait.py
phish wrapper = Python
</P>
<P>explain acronym
what each word means
</P>
<P>minnow
school
input script
bait.py
</P>
<P>school of minnows swim in a stream, doing something
coordinated.
</P>
<P>A PHISH input script allows specification of the set of programs to
launch as independent processes, how many copies of each are inovked,
and the topology of how they connect to each other as they send and
receive data.  Thus the input script encodes an algorithm for
processing continuous data from a stream source or archived data from
files.  The supported communication topologies include a "hashed" mode
of messaging where a "key" is hashed to determine what process to send
data to, which is a means of exploiting parallelism in a streaming
context, akin to a MapReduce operation.
</P>
<P>The sending and receiving of datums between processes is handled
within the PHISH library either by calls to the message-passing
interface (MPI) library, or by sockets via the ZMQ library.  A PHISH
tool converts the input script into a configuration file that can be
launched by either MPI or a shell script.  In the former case, a PHISH
program can run on any platform that supports MPI.  In the latter
case, a PHISH program can run on a single desktop machine or across
any network of (geographically distributed) machines that support
socket connections.

<A NAME = "intro_4"></A><H4>1.4 Steps to creating and running a PHISH program 
</H4>
<P>a) write one or more minnows that call the PHISH library
b) write a script listing the minnows and the communication patterns between them
c) ues the Bait.py tool to process the input script
c) run the file (via MPI or a shell script) produced by Bait.py
</P>
<P>PHISH has 2 parts: Python script (bait.py) and library (libphish.a)
</P>
<P>But can also process corpus of files.
</P>
<P>Break stream up into datums = chunk of bytes.
</P>
<P>show commands to run the launch script
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "intro_5"></A><H4>1.5 Simple example 
</H4>
<P>Here is an example of using a PHISH program to count the number of
times different words appear in a corpus of text files.  This is
effectively a MapReduce operation, where individual minnow processes
perform the map() and reduce() functions.  This is a diagram of how 5
different kinds of minnows can beconnected together to perform the
computation:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "JPG/wordcount.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Code for all 5 of these minnows is in the example directory of the
PHISH distribution, both in C++ and Python.  The <I>FileGen</I> minnow
takes a list of files and/or directories as user input, searches them
recursively, and generates a series of filenames.  The filenames are
sent one-at-a-time to one of several <I>File2Words</I> minnows.  Each
receives a filename as input, opens and reads the content, and parses
it into words.  Each word is hashed and sent to a specific <I>Count</I>
minnow.  The key point is that each <I>Count</I> minnow will receive all
occurrences of a subset of possible words.  It stores an internal hash
table and counts the occurrences of each word it receives.
</P>
<P>When the <I>FileGen</I> minnow sends the last filename if finds, it sends a
"done" message to each of the <I>File2Words</I> minnows.  When they receive
a "done" message, they send a "done" message to each <I>Count</I> minnow.
When a <I>Count</I> minnow receives a "done" message from all the
<I>File2Words</I> minnows, it sends its entire list of unique words and
associated counts to the <I>Sort</I> minnow, followed by a "done" message.
When the <I>Sort</I> minnow has received "done" message from all the
upstream <I>Count</I> minnows, it knows it has received a list of all the
unique words in the corpus of documents, and the count for each one.
It sorts the list by count and sends the top <I>N</I> to the <I>Print</I>
minnow, one by one, followed by a "done" message.  <I>N</I> is a
user-defined parameter.  The <I>Print</I> minnow echoes each datum it
receives to the screen or a file, until if receives a "done" message.
At this point all minnows in the school have been shut down.
</P>
<P>More details about this example are discussed in subsequent sections
of the manual.
</P>
<P>In <A HREF = "Bait.html#bait_4">this section</A> of the <A HREF = "Bait.html">Bait.py Tool</A> doc
page, the PHISH input script that encodes the minnows and
communication connections of the above diagram is discussed, and its
processing by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.
</P>
<P>In <A HREF = "Minnows.html#minnow_1">this section</A> of the <A HREF = "Minnows.html">PHISH
Minnows</A> doc page, the code for the <I>Count</I> minnow is
discussed in detail, to illustrate what calls it makes to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A> to send and receive datums.
</P>
<P>In <A HREF = "Librarry.html#datum">this section</A> of the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
Library</A> doc page, the format of datums exchanged between
minnows is discussed.
</P>
<P>Note that like a MapReduce, the PHISH program runs in parallel, since
there can be N <I>File2Words</I> minnows and M <I>Count</I> minnows where N >=1,
M >=1, and N = M is not required.  This is similar to the option in
<A HREF = "hadoop">Hadoop</A> to vary the numbers of mappers and reducers.
</P>
<P>However, there are also some differences between how this PHISH
program works as compared to a traditional MapReduce, e.g. as
typically performed via <A HREF = "hadoop">Hadoop</A> or the <A HREF = "mrmpi">MapReduce-MPI
library</A>.
</P>
<P>In a traditional MapReduce, the "map" stage (performed by the
<I>File2Words</I> minnows) creates a huge list of all the words, including
duplicates, found in the corpus of documents, which is stored
internally (in memory or on disk) until the "mapper" process is
finished with all the files it processes.  Each mapper then sends
chunks of the list to each "reduce" process (performed by the <I>Count</I>
minnows).  This is the "shuffle" phase of a Hadoop MapReduce.
The reducer performs a merge sort of all the words in the chunks
it receives (one from each mapper).  It can then calculate the
count for each unique word.
</P>
<P>In contrast, the PHISH program operates in a more continuous fashion,
streaming the data (words in this case) through the minnows, without
ever storing the full data set.  Only a small list of unique words is
stored (by the <I>Count</I> minnows), each with a running counter.  In this
example, PHISH exchanges data between minnows via many tiny messages
(one word per message), whereas a traditional MapReduce would
aggregate the data into a few large messages.
</P>
<P>This is a simplistic explanation; a fuller description is more
complex.  <A HREF = "hadoop">Hadoop</A>, for example, can operate in streaming mode
for some forms of MapReduce operations, which include this wordcount
example.  (MapReduce operations where the "reducer" needs all data
associated with a key at one time, are not typically amenable to a
streaming mode of operation.)  The PHISH minnows used in this school
could be modified so as to aggregate data into larger and fewer
messages.
</P>
<P>However the fundamental attributes of the PHISH program are important
to understand.  Data moves continuously, in small chunks, through a
school of minnows.  Each minnow may store "state" information about
the data it has previously seen, but typically not all the data
itself.  "State" is typically limited to information that can be
stored in-memory, not on disk.  This is because for streaming data,
too much data arrives too quickly, for a minnow to perform much
computation before discarding it or sending it on to another minnow.
</P>
<P>Here is a diagram of a variant of the wordcount operation that
illustrates how PHISH can be used to process continuous, streaming
data.  The PHISH program in this case might run for days or weeks,
without using the "done" messages described above.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "JPG/wordcount2.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>In this case the <I>FileGen</I> minnow is continuously seeing new files
appear in directories it monitors.  The words in those files are
processed as they appear.  A <I>Trigger</I> minnow has been added which
accepts user queries, e.g. via a keyboard or a socket connection.
When the user makes a request (hits a key), a message is sent to each
of the <I>Count</I> minnows on a different input port than it receives
words from the <I>File2Words</I> minnows; see <A HREF = "Minnows.html#minnow_2">this
section</A> of the <A HREF = "Minnows.html">PHISH Minnows</A> doc
page for a discussion of ports.  The message triggers the <I>Count</I>
minnows to send their current unique word/count list to the <I>Sort</I>
minnow which is sorted and printed via the <I>Print</I> minnow.
</P>
<P>The PHISH job now runs continuously and a user can query the current
top N words as often as desired.  The <I>FileGen</I>, <I>Count</I>, and <I>Sort</I>
minnows would have to be modified, but only in small ways, to work in
this mode.  Additional logic could be added (e.g. another user
request) to re-initialize counts or accumulate counts in a
time-windowed fashion.
