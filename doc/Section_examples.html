<H3>5. Examples 
</H3>
<P>Below is the list of PHISH input scripts provided in the examples
directory of the distribution.  Many of them come in two flavors,
using minnows written in C++, or minnows written in Python.  The
scripts can also be edited to use a mixture of C++ and Python minnows
in the same PHISH net.  See the comment lines at the top of each
script for instructions on what variables they expect to be defined
via command-line arguements to the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool.
</P>
<P>As discussed in <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_4">this section</A> of the
<A HREF = "Section_intro.html">Introduction</A>, the <A HREF = "Section_bait.html">bait.py</A>
tool produces an output file.  The output file can be launched as a
parallel job by the MPI commands mpirun or mpiexec, if the minnows
specified in the input script were built with the MPI version of the
PHISH library.  Or the output file can be used with the "launch.py"
tool to run a parallel job if the minnows were built with the socket
version of the PHISH library.

<H4>in.pp 
</H4>
<H4>in.pp.py 
</H4>
<P>These scripts ping-pong a message back-and-forth between 2 minnows,
<A HREF = "ping.html">ping</A> and <A HREF = "pong.html">pong</A>.  Each minnow is connected to
the other and they exchange a M byte message N times.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of how to process the script with bait.py:
</P>
<PRE>../bait/bait.py -v m 1000 -v n 100 -p ../minnow < in.pp 
</PRE>
<P>can M and N be defined with default values in input script?
</P>
<HR>

<H4>in.wc 
</H4>
<H4>in.wc.py 
</H4>
<P>These script perform a word frequency count across a set of input text
files, similar to a MapReduce operation.  It uses the
<A HREF = "filegen.html">filegen</A>, <A HREF = "readfile.html">readfile</A>, <A HREF = "count.html">count</A>,
<A HREF = "sort.html">sort</A>, and <A HREF = "print.html">print</A> minnows, connected as
diagramed in <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_5">this section</A> of the
<A HREF = "Section_intro.html">Introduction</A>.
</P>
<P>The scripts can perfrom the operation in parallel by changing the size
of the school of <A HREF = "readfile.html">readfile</A> and <A HREF = "count.html">count</A>
minnows in the <A HREF = "bait_school.html">school</A> commands within the input
script.  They can process a large corpus of files by specifying one or
more directory names as arguments to the <A HREF = "filegen.html">filegen</A>
minnow.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of how to process the script with bait.py:
</P>
<PRE>../bait/bait.py -v files in.* -p ../minnow < in.wc 
</PRE>
<P>make Nmap and Nreduce variables
</P>
<HR>

<H4>in.wrapsink 
</H4>
<H4>in.wrapsink.py 
</H4>
<P>These scripts demonstrate the use of the <A HREF = "wrapsink.html">wrapsink</A>
minnow which is used to wrap a non-PHISH application.  The program
reads from stdin to receive messages sent to it from other minnows,
and writes directly to stdout.
</P>
<P>In this case the "reverse" program in the minnows directory is wrapped
and it reverses each filename in a list of input filenames.  Multiple
copies of <A HREF = "reverse.html">reverse</A> can be launched by changing the size
of the school of <A HREF = "wrapsink.html">wrapsink</A> minnows in the
<A HREF = "bait_school.html">school</A> commands within the input script.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of how to process the script with bait.py:
</P>
<PRE>../bait/bait.py -v files in.* -p ../minnow < in.wrapsink 
</PRE>
<P>make school arg a variable
</P>
<HR>

<H4>in.wrapss 
</H4>
<H4>in.wrapss.py 
</H4>
<P>These scripts are similar to the preceding in.wrapsink scripts.  They
reverse each filename in a list of input filenames.  In this case the
<A HREF = "reverse.html">reverse</A> program is wrapped with the
<A HREF = "wrapss.html">wrapss</A> tool which lets the program read from stdin to
receive messages sent to it from other minnows, and sends the output
it writes to stdout as messages to downstream minnows, in this case
the <A HREF = "print.html">print</A> minnow.  As before, multiple copies of
<A HREF = "reverse.html">reverse</A> can be launched by changing the size of the
school of <A HREF = "wrapss.html">wrapss</A> minnows in the
<A HREF = "bait_school.html">school</A> commands within the input script.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of how to process the script with bait.py:
</P>
<PRE>../bait/bait.py -v files in.* -p ../minnow < in.wrapss 
</PRE>
<P>make school arg(s) a variable
</P>
