<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Pong is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows via its input and output ports.
</P>
<P>The pong minnow is designed for use with the <A HREF = "ping.hmtl">ping</A>
minnow, to exchange datums back and forth.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The pong minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one output
port 0 to send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>When it starts, the pong minnow calls the <A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A>
function.  Each time a datum is received on input port 0 (i.e. from
the ping minnow), it is re-sent to output port 0.
</P>
<P>The pong minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>The pong minnow does not care what kinds of datums it receives and
re-sends.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The default buffer size for sending and receiving datums is 1 Kbyte.
To use an <I>M</I> value that exceeds this, use the "set memory" command
should be used in the PHISH input script so that the PHISH library
allocates larger buffers.
