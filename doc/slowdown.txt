read datum and emit it with slowdown delay

syntax: slowdown delta
delta = time to delay (in seconds)

read each datum and insure delay seconds have passed
before writing it downstream

for each datum:
  query time since last datum was processed and invoke usleep() if needed
  send entire datum downstream
