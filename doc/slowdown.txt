slowdown minnow :h3

[Syntax:]

slowdown delta :pre

delta = delay in seconds :ul

[Examples:]

count :pre

[Description:]

Slowdown is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In
"PHISH lingo"_Section_intro.html#intro_2, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.

The slowdown minnow sends datums as it receives them, but insures
successive datums are sent no more often than every {delta} seconds.
This can be useful for debugging PHISH nets that process
data quickly.

[Ports:]

The shutdown minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one
output port 0 to send datums.

[Operation:]

When it starts, the shutdown minnow calls the
"phish_loop"_phish_recv.html function.  Each time a datum is received
on input port 0, the phish_timer function is called and the elapsed
time since the last datum was sent is calculated.  If it is less
than {delta} seconds, the minnow "sleeps" until {delta} seconds have
passed.  It then sends the datum to its output port 0 and records
the time at which the send occurred.

The count minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.

[Data:]

The shutdown minnow does not care what kinds of datums it receives and
re-sends.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related minnows:] none
