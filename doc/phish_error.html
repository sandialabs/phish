<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>There are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions print error or warning messages.  The phish_error()
and phish_abort() functions also cause a PHISH program and all of its
minnows to exit.
</P>
<P>These functions can be called by a minnow, but are also called
internally by the PHISH library when error conditions are encountered.
</P>
<P>Also note that unlike calling <A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A>, these
functions do not close a minnows input or output ports.  The latter
trigger "done" messages to be sent to downstream minnows.  This means
that no other minnows are explicitly told about the failed minnow.
However, see the discussion below about the phish_abort() function and
its effect on other minnows.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_error() function prints the specified character string to
the screen, invokes the user-specified abort callback function if it
is defined via <A HREF = "phish_callback.html">phish_callback</A>, then calls
phish_abort().
</P>
<P>The error message is printed in this format for the MPI version of the
MPI library (replated MPI by SOCKET for the socket version):
</P>
<PRE>PHISH MPI ERROR: Minnow exename ID idminnow # idglobal: message 
</PRE>
<P>where exename is the name of executable minnow file (not the full
path, just the filename), idminnow is the ID of the minnow as
specified in the PHISH input script, idglobal is the global-ID of the
minnow, and message is the error message.  Each minnow has a global ID
from 0 to Nglobal-1, where Nglobal is the total number of minnows in
the school of minnows specified by the PHISH input script.  This
supplementary information is helpful in debugging which minnow
generated the error message.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_warn() function prints the specified character string to the
screen, in the same format as phish_error(), execpt ERROR is replaced
by WARNING.  The abort callback is not invoked and neither is
phish_abort().  Control is simply returned to the calling minnow which
can continue on.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_abort() function prints no message.  
</P>
<P>For the MPI version of the PHISH library, phish_abort() invokes
MPI_Abort(), which should force all minnows in the PHISH school to
exit, and the "mpirun" or "mpiexec" command that launced the school to
exit.
</P>
<P>TIM: how does this work for socket version?  Does it cause
all minnows to exit?
