<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A>.
</P>
<P>These functions print error or warning messages.  The phish_error()
and phish_abort() functions also cause a PHISH program and all of its
minnows to exit.
</P>
<P>These functions can be called by a minnow, but are also called
internally by the PHISH library when error conditions are encountered.
</P>
<P>Also note that unlike calling <A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A>, these
functions do not close a minnow's input or output ports, or
trigger "done" messages to be sent to downstream minnows.  This means
that no other minnows are explicitly told about the failed minnow.
However, see the discussion below about the phish_abort() function and
its effect on other minnows.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_error() function prints the specified character string to
the screen, then calls phish_abort().
</P>
<P>The error message is printed with the following format:
</P>
<PRE>PHISH ERROR: Minnow executable ID school-id # global-id: message 
</PRE>
<P>where "executable" is the name of executable minnow file (not the full path,
just the filename), "school-id" is the ID of the minnow as specified in the
PHISH input script, "global-id" is the global-ID of the minnow, and message is
the error message.  Each minnow has a global ID from 0 to Nglobal-1, where
Nglobal is the total number of minnows in the net specified by the PHISH input
script.  This supplementary information is helpful in debugging which minnow
generated the error message.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_warn() function prints the specified character string to the screen,
in the same format as phish_error(), execpt ERROR is replaced by WARNING.
phish_abort() is not invoked and control is simply returned to the calling
minnow which can continue executing.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The phish_abort() function invokes the user-specified abort callback function
defined via <A HREF = "phish_callback.html">phish_callback</A>.  If the callback function
does not cancel the abort, the minnow exits.
</P>
<P>For the MPI version of the PHISH library, phish_abort() invokes MPI_Abort(),
which should force all minnows in the PHISH school to exit, along with the
"mpirun" or "mpiexec" command that launched the net.
</P>
<P>For the ZMQ version of the PHISH library, phish_abort() behavior is undefined.
We intend that in future versions of PHISH, all minnows in the net will exit.
