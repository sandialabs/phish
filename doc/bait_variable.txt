variable command :h3

[Syntax:]

variable ID str1 str2 ... :pre

[Examples:]

variable files f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt
variable N 100 :pre

[Description:]

Variable is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which
is recognized by the "bait.py"_Section_bait.html setup program.  It
creates a variable with name {ID} which contains a list of one or more
strings.  The variable can be used elsewhere in the input script.  The
substitution rules for variables are described by the
"bait.py"_Section_bait.html doc page.

The {ID} of the variable can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.  The strings can contain any printable character.

A variable can only be defined once, i.e. IDs must be unique.  The one
exception is for variables defined as "command-line
arguments"_Section_bait.html#bait_3 to the "bait.py"_Section_bait.html
command.  In this case, a variable command in the input script is
ignored if the variable was already set in the command line.  This
allows an input script to set default values for variables that can be
overridden by command-line settings.

:line

There is one variable that must be set when using the ZMQ backend to
"bait.py"_Section_bait.html.  Its ID is "hostnames" and it should be
set to the list of hostnames on which to launch the PHISH job.  If you
are running on a large parallel machine, it is typically the names of
the nodes assigned to your job by the batch allocator.  If you are
running on your desktop, it can be just the hostname of your machine.
E.g.

variable hostnames node3 node4 node10
variable hostnames mybox
variable hostnames mybox otherbox.localnet.gov :pre

This variable is used by the ZMQ backend to determine what host to
launch each minnow on.  See the bind option of the "bait.py
school"_bait_school.html command for further discussion on how to
assign specific minnows to specific hosts.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

Any variable can be set either in a PHISH input script or via the
{--variable} or {-v} command-line arguments of the
"bait.py"_Secttion_bait.html tool.

[Default:] none
