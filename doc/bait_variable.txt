[Examples:]

variable N 100 :pre

[Description:]

Variable is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which
is recognized by the "bait.py"_Bait.html setup program.  It creates a
variable with name {ID} which contains a list of one or more strings.
The variable can be used elsewhere in the input script.  The
substitution rules for variables are described by the
"bait.py"_Bait.html doc page.

The {ID} of the variable can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.  The strings can contain any printable character.

A variable can only be defined once, i.e. IDs must be unique.  The one
exception is for variables defined as "command-line
arguments"_Section_bait.html#bait_3 to the "bait.py"_Section_bait.html
command.  In this case, a variable command in the input script is
ignored if the variable was already set in the command line.
This allows an input script to set default values for variables
that can be overridded by command-line settings.

[Restrictions:] none
