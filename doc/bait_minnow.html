</P>
<P>Minnow is a command that can be used in a PHISH input script which is
recognized by the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> setup program.  It defines a
minnow application and assigns it an ID which can be used elsewhere in
the input script.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>The <I>ID</I> of the minnow can only contain alphanumeric characters and
underscores.
</P>
<P>The <I>exefile</I> is the name of the executable which will be launched
when the PHISH program is run.  It should reside in one of the
directories specified by the <I>-path</I> command-line argument for
<A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A>.
</P>
<P>The <I>arg1</I>, <I>arg2</I>, etc keywords are arguments that will be passed
to the <I>exefile</I> program when it is launched.
