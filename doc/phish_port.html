<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>There are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In <A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow"
is a stand-alone application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH
library</A>.
</P>
<P>The phish_input() and phish_output() functions define input and output
ports for the minnow.  An input port is where datums are sent by other
minnows, so they can be read by this minnow.  An output port is where
the minnow sends datums to route them to the input ports of other
minnows.  These inter-minnow connections are setup by the
<A HREF = "bait_connect.html">connect</A> command in a PHISH input script, as
discussed on the <A HREF = "Bait.html">bait.py</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>A minnnow can define and use multiple input and output ports, to send
and receive datums of different kinds to different sets of minnows.
Both input and output ports are numbered from 0 to Pmax-1, where Pmax
= the maximum allowed ports, which is a hard-coded value in
src/phish.cpp.  It is currently set to 16; most minnows use 1 or 2.
Note that a single port can be used to send or receive datums to many
other minnows (processors), depending on the connection style.  See
the <A HREF = "bait_connect.html">connect</A> command for details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The minnow should make one call to phish_input() for each input port
it uses, whether or not a particular PHISH input script actually
connects to the port.  Specify <I>reqflag</I> = 1 if a PHISH input script
must specify a connection to the input port in order to use the
minnow; specify <I>reqflag</I> = 0 if it is optional.  The
<A HREF = "phish_check.html">phish_check</A> function will check for compatibility
between the PHISH input script and the minnow ports.
</P>
<P>Two callback function pointers are passed as arguments to
phish_input().  Either or both can be specied as <I>NULL</I>, or <I>None</I> in
the Python version, if the minnow does not require a callback.  Note
that multiple input ports can use the same callback functions.
</P>
<P>The first callback is <I>datumfunc</I>, and is called by the PHISH library
each time a datum is received on that input port.
</P>
<P>The <I>datumfunc</I> function should have the following form:
</P>
<PRE>void datumfunc(int nfields) {
} 
</PRE>
<P>or
</P>
<PRE>def datumfunc(nfields) 
</PRE>
<P>in Python,
</P>
<P>where "datumfunc" is replaced by a function name of your choice.  The
function is passed "nfields" = the # of fields in the received datum.
See the <A HREF = "phish_unpack.html">phish_unpack</A> and
<A HREF = "phish_datum.html">phish_datum</A> doc pages for info on how the received
datum can be further processed.
</P>
<P>The second callback is <I>donefunc</I>, and is a called by the PHISH
library when the input port is closed.
</P>
<P>The <I>donefunc</I> function should have the following form:
</P>
<PRE>void donefunc() {
} 
</PRE>
<P>or
</P>
<PRE>def donefunc() 
</PRE>
<P>in Python,
</P>
<P>where "donefunc" is replaced by a function name of your choice.  A
minnow might use the function to print out some statistics about data
received thru that input port, or its closure might trigger further
data to be sent downstream to other minnows.  See the
<A HREF = "phish_close.html">phish_close</A> function and <A HREF = "Minnows.html#shutdown">shutdown
section</A> of the <A HREF = "Minnows.html">Minnows</A> doc page,
for more discussion of how a school of minnows closes ports and shuts
down.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The minnow should make one call to phish_output() for each output port
it uses, whether or not a particular PHISH input script actually
connects to the port.  Usage of an output port by an input script is
always optional.  This makes it easy to develop and debug a sequence
of pipelined operations, one minnow at a time, without requiring a
minnow's output to be used by an input script.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>These functions cannot be called after <A HREF = "phish_check.html">phish_check</A>
has been called.
