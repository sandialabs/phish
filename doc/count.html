<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Count is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows.
</P>
<P>The count minnow counts occurrences of strings it receives.  When it
shuts down it sends unique words and their associated counts.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The count minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one
output port 0 to send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>When it starts, the count minnow calls the
<A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> function.  Each time a datum is received
on input port 0, its first field is a string.  Unique strings are
stored in an internal table, using the string as a "key".  This is
done via an STL "map" in the C++ version of count, and via a
"dictionary" in the Python version of count.  The value associated
with each key is a count of the number of times the string has been
received.
</P>
<P>The count minnow shuts down when its input port is closed by receiving
a sufficient number of "done" messages.  This triggers the count
minnow to send a series of datums to its ouput port 0, one for each
unique word it has received.  Each datum contains two fields. The
first field is the count, the second is the string.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>The count minnow must receive single field datums of type
PHISH_STRING.  It send two-field datums of type (PHISH_INT32,
PHISH_STRING).
