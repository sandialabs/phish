<HTML>
<P>count instances of keyed datums
</P>
<P>syntax: no args
</P>
<P>creates an internal hash, so it can count instances of keys
hash key = string, hash value = count
keeps track of largest key it receives
</P>
<P>for each datum:
  treat buf of nbytes as a string and hash it
  increment hash value for that string
</P>
<P>when done:
  iterate over hash table
  send all hash entries downstream as count/string
