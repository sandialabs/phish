6. Python Interface to PHISH :h3

A Python wrapper for the PHISH library is included in the
distribution.  This allows a minnow written in Python to call the
PHISH library.  The advantage of using Python is how concise the
language is, enabling rapid development and debugging of PHISH minnows
and nets.  The disadvantage is speed, since Python is slower than a
compiled language and there is an extra layer of callback functions
between C++ and Python, when receipt of a datum makes a callback to a
minnow written in Python.

Before using the PHISH library in a Python script, the Python on your
machine must be able to find the PHISH library and wrapper.  This is
discussed below.

The Python interface to the PHISH library is very similar to the C
interface.  See "this section"_Section_library.html#library_3 of the
doc pages for a brief overview.  "Individual library
function"_Section_library.html#library_1 doc pages give examples of
how to use the Python interface.

[Extending Python with the PHISH library]

For a Python minnow to use the PHISH library, it must find two files
at run-time that are part of PHISH.  The first is the PHISH wrapper.
The second is the PHISH library.  It must also be able to find other
shared libraries that the PHISH library depends on, e.g. MPI or ZMQ
libraries, which is discussed in the next section.

There are two different ways to enable Python to find the two PHISH
files.

(1) Add two lines to your shell start-up script.

For csh or tcsh, add lines like these to your .cshrc file:

setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/home/sjplimp/phish/python
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/sjplimp/phish/src :pre

For bash, add lines like these to your .bashrc file:

export PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/home/tshead/src/phish/python
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/tshead/build/phish/src :pre

After editing your shell start-up script, be sure to invoke it,
e.g. source .cshrc.

Note: On OSX systems, use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

(2) Add the Python wrapper to the site-packages directory of your
installed Python and the PHISH library to a directory the system looks
in to load shared libraries.

The site-packages dir is typically something like
/usr/lib/python/site-packages if you are using the system Python, or
/usr/local/lib/python/site-packages if you installed Python yourself.

Lines like these will copy the needed files:

% cp -r /home/sjplimp/phish/python/phish /usr/local/lib/python/site-packages
% cp /home/sjplimp/phish/src/*.so /usr/local/lib :pre

The latter command will copy all the PHISH shared libraries you have
built, including the "bait.py tool"_Section_bait.html backends.  The
latter is necessary for using bait.py.

You will need to prefix the lines with "sudo" if you need permission
to copy into directories owned by root.

[Creating a shared MPI or ZMQ library] :link(shared)

To use the MPI or ZMQ version of the PHISH library from a Python
minnow, a shared-library version of MPI or ZMQ must also exist, in a
place the system can find it.  On Linux this is a library file that
ends in ".so", not ".a".  Such a shared library may not normally not
built if you installed MPI or ZMQ yourself, but it is easy to do.
Here is how to do it for "MPICH"_mpich, a popular open-source version
of MPI, distributed by Argonne National Labs.  From within the mpich
directory, type

:link(mpich,http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi)

./configure --enable-sharedlib=gcc
make
make install :pre

You may need to prepend "sudo" to the last line.  The end result
should be the file libmpich.so put into /usr/local/lib.  As an
alternative to the final make install, you can add the directory the
libmpich.so file is in to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable,
as illustrated above.

To build ZMQ as a shared library, you may need to specify --enable-shared
during the configuration process, which is the default.

[Testing the PHISH library from Python] :link(test)

To test if your Python can find all the files it needs to use the
PHISH library, launch python and type:

>>> import phish

If you don't get an error, you're good to go.
