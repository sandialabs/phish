<H3>2. Bait.py Tool 
</H3>
<P>Bait.py is a Python program which parses a PHISH input script and uses
a dynamically-loaded backend to directly run a PHISH net and perform a
calculation, or create a script that can be used to do the same.  In
<A HREF = "Section_intro.html#intro_2">PHISH lingo</A>, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows via its input and output ports.
A "net" is collection of schools of minnows.
</P>
<P>There are Bait backends for running a PHISH net using MPI, running a
PHISH net using ZMQ, generating configuraiton files for MPI or ZMQ,
and generating a GraphViz "dotfile" that can be converted into a
diagram of a PHISH net.
</P>
<P>You can edit the input script or pass it different parameters via
bait.py command-line arguments to change the calculation.  Re-running
bait.py will run a new net or create a new script.
</P>
<P>The remainder of this page discusses how bait.py is used and how a
PHISH input script is formatted.  The input script commands recognized
by bait.py have their own doc pages.

<A NAME = "bait_2"></A><H4>2.2 Building and running bait.py 
</H4>
<P>Before using bait.py for the first time, one or more backend libraries
must be built which bait.py uses for interfacing to MPI and/or ZMQ.
This creates shared libraries which your Python must also be able to
find.
</P>
<P>You can build one or more of the backend libraries from the src
directory of the distribution by typing one or more of these lines:
</P>
<PRE>make -f Makefile.machine baitmpi
make -f Makefile.machine baitmpiconfig
make -f Makefile.machine baitzmq
make -f Makefile.machine baitgraph
make -f Makefile.machine baitnull 
</PRE>
<P>where "machine" is the name of one of the Makefiles in the directory.
These should produce files like libphish-bait-mpi.so or
libphish-bait-zmq.so.  See the discussion of the --backend
command-line switch in the next section, for the difference between
the various backend options.  See the discussion in <A HREF = "Section_library.html#library_2">this
section</A> if none of the provided
Makefiles are a match to your machine.
</P>
<P>TIM: doc how to do this via cmake?
</P>
<P>When you run bait.py, your Python must be able to find the appropriate
backend shared library.  The simplest way to do this is
to add a line to your shell start-up script.
</P>
<P>For csh or tcsh, add a line like this to your .cshrc file:
</P>
<PRE>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $<I>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</I>:/home/sjplimp/phish/src 
</PRE>
<P>For bash, add a line like this to your .bashrc file:
</P>
<P>TIM: what would this line be?
</P>
<P>After editing your shell start-up script, be sure to invoke it,
e.g. source .cshrc.
</P>
<P>See the discussion in <A HREF = "Section_python.html">this section</A> for an
alternative way to do this.
</P>
<P>You are now ready to use the bait.py tool.  It is a Python script in
the bait directory of the PHISH distribution.  Like any Python script
you can run it in one of two ways:
</P>
<PRE>bait.py --switch value(s) ... < in.script
python bait.py --switch values ... < in.script 
</PRE>
<P>For the first case, you need to insure that the first line of bait.py
gives the correct path to the Python installed on your machine, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>#!/usr/local/bin/python 
</PRE>
<P>and that the bait.py file is executable, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>chmod +x bait.py 
</PRE>
<P>Normally you will want to invoke bait.py from the directory where your
PHISH input script is, so you may need to prepend bait.py with a path
or make an alias for running it conveniently.
</P>
<P>The switch/value command-line arguments recognized by bait.py are
discussed in the next section.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "bait_3"></A><H4>2.3 Command-line arguments 
</H4>
<P>These are the command-line arguments recognized by bait.py.  Each is
specified as "-switch value(s)".  Each switch has an abbreviated form;
several of them have default settings.
</P>
<UL><LI>-h or --help
<LI>-b BACK or --backend BACK
<LI>-l LAUNCHER or --launch LAUNCHER
<LI>-p PATH1:PATH2:... or --path PATH1:PATH2:...
<LI>-s NAME VALUE or --set NAME VALUE
<LI>-x SUFFIX or --suffix SUFFIX
<LI>-v NAME VALUE or --variable NAME VALUE
<LI>--verbose 
</UL>
<P>Use <I>--help</I> to display a help message and exit.
</P>
<P>Use <I>--backend</I> to select the desired bait.py backend.  The choice of
backend defines how the input script will be interpreted to run a
PHISH net.  Current choices for BACK are "graphviz", "mpi",
"mpi-config", "null", and "zmq".  We plan to add a "zmq-config"
option.
</P>
<UL><LI>The graphviz backend will write a GraphViz file in DOT format to
stdout.  You can process this file using any of the GraphViz tools to
create a diagram of your PHISH net, useful for documentation or
presentations. 

<LI>The mpi backend will run your PHISH net immediately using the mpiexec
command, which must be available somewhere on your system PATH. 

<LI>The mpi-config backend will write an mpiexec compatible config file to
stdout.  You can then run your PHISH net any time by passing the
generated file to mpiexec. 

<LI>The null backend is a do-nothing backend that is useful for
troubleshooting.  For example, you can combine the --verbose option
with the null backend to confirm that variables are expanded correctly
in your PHISH input script. 

<LI>The zmq backend will run your PHISH net immediately using ZMQ
sockets. 
</UL>
<P>The <I>--launch</I> option will use the program LAUNCHER to invoke all the
minnows.  This is useful if the minnow is a Python script, in which
case --launch python will launch the minnow using Python.  LAUNCH can
be multiple words if desired, e.g. --launch python -x.
</P>
<P>The <I>--path</I> option specifies a colon-separated list of one or more
directories as PATH1, PATH2, etc.  When bait.py processes each minnow,
as specified by the <A HREF = "bait_minnow.html">minnow</A> command, it looks for
the minnow's executable file in this list of directories, so that it
can write it to the launch script with an absolute path name.
</P>
<P>Use <I>--set</I> to set an option for the input script that is the same as
if the <A HREF = "bait_set.html">set</A> command had been used in the input script
with NAME and VALUE.  For example, --set memory 5 is the same as using
"set memory 5" in the input script to specify the maximum datum size
to 5 Kbytes.  A value specified in the input script will override a
command-line setting.
</P>
<P>Use <I>--suffix</I> to supply a SUFFIX string that will be appended to the
name of each minnow executable in your input script.  This is useful
when you have minnow executables that have been built using different
communication backends - for example, if you have a minnow "foo.c",
you might link it against the MPI and ZMQ backends to produce two
executables, "foo-mpi", and "foo-zmq".  Using the <I>--suffix</I> option,
you can create a single PHISH input script and run it against either
executable by specifying --suffix=-mpi or --suffix=-zmq.  It is also
useful if a minnow is a Python script, ending in ".py", in which case
you could specify --suffix=.py and use the <I>--launch</I> option to invoke
the minnow with Python.
</P>
<P>The <I>--variable</I> switch defines a variable that can be used within the
script.  It can be used multiple times to define different variables
with NAME and VALUE.  A <A HREF = "bait_variable.html">variable</A> command can also
be used in the input script itself.  The VALUE specified on the
command-line will override the value of a variable with the same
NAME in the input script, which allows you to set a default value
in the input script and overrided it via the command line.
</P>
<P>The variable NAME and VALUE are any alphanumeric string.  A list of
strings can also be assigned to it, e.g. a series of filenames.  For
example,
</P>
<PRE>bait.py --variable files *.cpp < in.phish 
</PRE>
<P>creates the variable named "files" containing a list of all CPP files
in the current directory.
</P>
<P>The <I>--verbose</I> option causes bait.py to produce verbose output while
processing your input script.  The verbose output will vary depending
on the backend in use, and will be written to stderr.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "bait_4"></A><H4>2.4 Input script syntax and parsing 
</H4>
<P>A PHISH input script is a text file that contains commands, typically
one per line.
</P>
<P>Blank lines are ignored.  Any text following a "#" character is
treated as a comment and removed, including the "#" character.  If the
last printable character in the line is "&", then it is treated as a
continuation character, the next line is appended, and the same
procedure for stripping a "#" comment and checking for a trailing "&"
is repeated.
</P>
<P>The resulting command line is then searched for variable references.
A variable with a single-character name, such as "n", can be
referenced as $n.  A variable with a multi-character name (or
single-character name), such as "foo", is referenced as ${foo}.
Each variable found in the command line is replaced with the
variable's contents, which is a list of strings, separated by
whitespace.  Thus a variable "files" defined either by a bait.py
command-line argument or the <A HREF = "bait_variable.html">variable</A> command as
</P>
<PRE>-v files f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt
variable files f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt 
</PRE>
<P>would be substituted for in this command:
</P>
<PRE>minnow 1 filegen ${files} 
</PRE>
<P>so that the command becomes:
</P>
<PRE>minnow 1 filegen f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt 
</PRE>
<P>After variable substitution, a single command is a series of "words"
separated by whitespace.  The first word is the command name; the
remaining words are arguments.  The command names recognized by
bait.py are <A HREF = "#bait_1">listed above</A>.  Each command has its own syntax;
see its doc page for details.
</P>
<P>With one exception, commands in a PHISH input script can be listed in
any order.  The script is processed by bait.py after the entire script
is read.  The exception is that a variable cannot be used before it is
defined.
</P>

filenames or directories to the <I>filegen</I> minnow.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "bait_hook.html">hook</A> commands specify the communication pattern
used bewteen different schools of minnows.  The key pattern for this
example is the <I>hashed</I> style, which allows the <I>file2words</I> minnow to
pass a "key" (a word) to the PHISH library.  The library hashes the
word to determine which <I>count</I> minnow to send the datum to.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "bait_school.html">school</A> commands specify how many instances of
each minnow to launch.  Any number of <I>file2words</I> and <I>count</I> minnows

minnow, as defined by the input script.  The "-n N" specifies how many
copies of the minnow will be invoked.  The next argument is the name
of the minnow executable, followed by any minnow arguments, followed
by backend-specific arguments such as "-minnow", "-in", and "-out"
that encode the communication patterns between the minnows.

</P>
<P>This will launch 11 independent processes as an MPI job.  Each process
will call the PHISH library to exchange datums with other processes in
the pattern indicated in the diagram.  The datum exchanges will be
performed via MPI\Send() and MPI\_Recv() calls since the MPI backend
of the PHISH library is being invoked.
