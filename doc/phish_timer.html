<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a PHISH library function which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A>.
</P>
<P>This function provides a portable means to time operations within
a minnow.  For the MPI version of the PHISH library, the function
is a wrapper on MPI_Wtime().
</P>
<P>NOTE: how does this work for socket version?
</P>
<P>The function returns the current time in CPU seconds.  To calculated
an elapsed time, you need to bracket a section of code with 2 calls to
phish_timer() and calcualte the difference between the 2 returned
times, as in the example above.
