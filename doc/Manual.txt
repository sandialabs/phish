PHISH Tales :h2,c
(documentation for the PHISH library) :h2,c
17 Feb 2015 version :c,h4

Version info: :h4

The PHISH "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Nov
2012.  PHISH is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on "this page of
the WWW site"_bug.  Each dated copy of PHISH contains all the features
and bug-fixes up to and including that version date.  Each time you
use the "bait.py"_Section_bait.html tool, the version date is printed
to the screen.  It is also in the file bait/version.py and in the
PHISH directory name created when you unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the PHISH WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of PHISH. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have. :ule,l

PHISH stands for Parallel Harness for Informatic Stream Hashing.  The
phishy metaphor is meant to evoke the image of many small minnows
(programs) swimming in a stream (of data).

PHISH is a lightweight framework which a set of independent processes
can use to exchange data as they run on the same desktop machine, on
processors of a parallel machine, or on different machines across a
network.  This enables them to work in a coordinated parallel fashion
to perform computations on either streaming, archived, or
self-generated data.

The PHISH distribution includes a simple, portable library for
performing data exchanges in useful patterns either via "MPI
message-passing"_mpi or "ZMQ sockets"_zmq.  PHISH input scripts are
used to describe a data-processing algorithm, and additional tools
provided in the PHISH distribution convert the script into a form that
can be launched as a parallel job.

PHISH was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department
of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source
code, distributed freely under the terms of the "Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) License"_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license.

The authors of PHISH are Steve Plimpton and Tim Shead who can be
contacted at sjplimp, tshead at sandia.gov.  The "PHISH WWW Site"_pws
at http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/phish.html has more information
about the code and its uses.
