<H3>ping minnow 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>ping N M 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = # of datums to ping/pong with partner minnow
<LI>M = # of bytes in each datum

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Ping is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows via its input and output ports.
</P>
<P>The ping minnow is designed for use with the <A HREF = "pong.hmtl">pong</A>
minnow, to exchange datums back and forth.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The ping minnow uses one input port 0 to receive datums and one output
port 0 to send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>When it starts, the ping minnow creates a buffer <I>M</I> bytes long and
fills it with NULLs (zeroes).  It sends this buffer to its output port
0.  It then calls the <A HREF = "phish_recv.html">phish_loop</A> function.  Each
time a datum is received on input port 0 (i.e. from the pong minnow),
it is re-sent to output port 0.
</P>
<P>When the ping minnow receives a datum for the <I>N</I>th time, it calls the
<A HREF = "phish_exit.html">phish_exit</A> function to shut down.  It also prints
the elapsed time for exchanging an <I>M</I>-byte datum <I>N</I> times.
</P>
<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>The first datum the ping minnow sends has a single field of type
PHISH_RAW.  It does not care what kinds of datums it receives and
re-sends.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The default buffer size for sending and receiving datums is 1 Kbyte.
To use an <I>M</I> value that exceeds this, use the "set memory" command
should be used in the PHISH input script so that the PHISH library
allocates larger buffers.
