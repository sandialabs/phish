count instances of keyed datums

syntax: no args

creates an internal hash, so it can count instances of keys
hash key = string, hash value = count
keeps track of largest key it receives

for each datum:
  treat buf of nbytes as a string and hash it
  increment hash value for that string

when done:
  iterate over hash table
  send all hash entries downstream as count/string
