<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Rmat is a PHISH minnow that can be used in a PHISH program.  In PHISH
lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application which makes calls to
the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to exchange data with other PHISH
minnows via its input and output ports.
</P>
<P>The rmat minnow generates $N$ elements from an RMAT matrix of order
2^<I>Nlevel</I> in a random recursive fashion.  An RMAT matrix is a
randomized sparse matrix whose structure can be tailored by the input
parameters <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, and <I>d</I>.  The matrix is of order 2^<I>Nlevel</I>
and an element is represented by the I,J indices of the row and column
it is in.  The I,J values can also be interpreted as an edge in a
sparse graph between vertices I and J, where the vertices are numbered
from 1 to 2^<I>Nlevel</I> inclusive.
</P>
<P>The utility of RMAT matrices for describing graphs of various
kinds is discussed in <A HREF = "#Smith">(Smith)</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Ports:</B>
</P>
<P>The rmat minnow uses no input ports.  It uses one output port 0 to
send datums.
</P>
<P><B>Operation:</B>
</P>
<P>The rmat minnow generates <I>N</I> matrix elements and sends each as a
datum to its output port 0.  Each datum has 2 fields, which are the I
and J of the row and column of the matrix element.  I and J are both
integers from 1 to 2^<I>Nlevel</I> inclusive.
</P>
<P>The method of generating I and J is recursive with <I>Nlevel</I> levels.
At each stage one of 4 quadrants of the "current" matrix is selected
randomly with relative probablities <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, and <I>d</I>.  At the
first level, the current matrix is the entire matrix.  After selecting
a quadrant, that quadrant becomes the current matrix.  Thus as the
last level, a single I.J element is selected out of the original full
matrix.  The <I>twiddle</I> factor is used at each recursion level to
adjust <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, and <I>d</I> by a random fractional amount while
keeping the sum of the 4 values = 1.0.  This has the effect of further
randomizing the distribution of generated matrix elements.
</P>
<P>NOTE: better def of twiddle and is it 0 to 1?

<P><B>Data:</B>
</P>
<P>Each datum the rmat minnow sends has a two fields each of type
PHISH_UINT64.
