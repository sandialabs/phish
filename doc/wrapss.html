<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<PRE>ping N M 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = # of datums to ping/pong with partner minnow
<LI>M = # of bytes in each datum

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Ping is a PHISH minnow that can be used as one of a school of minnows
in a PHISH program.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone
application which makes calls to the <A HREF = "Library.html">PHISH library</A> to
exchange data with other PHISH minnows.
</P>
<P>wrap a child process which both consumes and creates datums via stdin/stdout
so child is a sink and a source
</P>
<P>syntax: wrapss "program"
"program" can be any string with flags, redirection, etc
enclose in quotes to prevent shell from processing it
</P>
<P>open 2 pipes to child via pipe()
fork() into parent and child processes
parent calls phish_probe() to query incoming messages and child output
child hooks its stdin/stdout to 2 pipes via dup2()
child invokes the "program" via execv()
</P>
<P>datum method:
  write datum to pipe with appended newline
</P>
<P>probe method:
  poll pipe for output from child
  if output is there, read it and break into lines
  phish_send() each line downstream as string w/out newline
</P>
<P>close method:
  close write pipe to child so it will know parent is done
  wait for all output from child read pipe
  send DONE message to notify receivers
</P>
