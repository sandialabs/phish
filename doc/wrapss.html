<HTML>
<P>wrap a child process which both consumes and creates datums via stdin/stdout
so child is a sink and a source
</P>
<P>syntax: wrapss "program"
"program" can be any string with flags, redirection, etc
enclose in quotes to prevent shell from processing it
</P>
<P>open 2 pipes to child via pipe()
fork() into parent and child processes
parent calls phish_probe() to query incoming messages and child output
child hooks its stdin/stdout to 2 pipes via dup2()
child invokes the "program" via execv()
</P>
<P>datum method:
  write datum to pipe with appended newline
</P>
<P>probe method:
  poll pipe for output from child
  if output is there, read it and break into lines
  phish_send() each line downstream as string w/out newline
</P>
<P>close method:
  close write pipe to child so it will know parent is done
  wait for all output from child read pipe
  send DONE message to notify receivers
</P>
